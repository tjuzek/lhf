Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain cancer, with a poor prognosis. Recent studies have identified two major subtypes of GBM: proneural and mesenchymal. The proneural subtype is characterized by a neural-like gene expression profile, while the mesenchymal subtype exhibits a more aggressive and fibroblastic phenotype. The molecular mechanisms underlying the distinction between these subtypes remain poorly understood. Using xenograft models and patient tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the REMBRANDT cohort, we investigated the role of PPARγ and STAT3 signaling pathways in glioblastoma subtypes. Our results show that the proneural subtype exhibits a higher expression of PPARγ and a lower expression of STAT3 signaling. In contrast, the mesenchymal subtype shows a higher expression of STAT3 signaling and a lower expression of PPARγ. We further demonstrate that ligand activation of PPARγ and inhibition of STAT3 signaling can inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models. Furthermore, we identify PPARγ as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for	Glioblastomas, a type of aggressive brain tumor, are heterogeneous and comprise various subtypes.

The findings revealed that PPARγ activation suppressed tumor growth and improved overall survival in both proneural and mesenchymal subtypes of glioblastoma. Notably, the proneural-mesenchymal transition, characterized by increased expression of STAT3 signaling, was associated with reduced sensitivity to PPARγ ligand activation. Our results suggest that PPARγ could be a valuable biomarker for glioblastoma treatment and that its ligand activation may provide a therapeutic strategy for reducing tumor burden and improving patient survival. Furthermore, the association between PPARγ and glioblastoma stem cells is a promising area of research, warranting further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship.

The proneural subtype is often associated with high tumor growth rates, poor survival rates, and poor response to conventional chemotherapy. The classical subtype, in contrast, tends to have a more favorable prognosis and better response to treatment. The mesenchymal subtype, characterized by the expression of mesenchymal markers, exhibits aggressive tumor behavior and poor response to conventional therapies. The genetic signature of the proneural subtype is associated with PPARγ, a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. The STAT3 signaling pathway is also implicated in the proneural subtype, contributing to drug resistance. A biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets reveals that the proneural subtype is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. The proneural-mesenchymal transition is a hallmark of glioblastoma progression, and is characterized by the ligand activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. This transition is associated with tumor growth and a higher tumor burden in xenograft models. Understanding the proneural subtype and its associated therapeutic targets is crucial for the development of effective treatments for glioblastoma.

The proneural and neural subtypes exhibit distinct genetic signatures and are more responsive to chemotherapy, whereas the classical and mesenchymal subtypes are more resistant. However, the mesenchymal subtype also shows a pronounced mesenchymal-proneural transition, leading to increased drug resistance. This transition is mediated by the ligand activation of PPARγ, leading to STAT3 signaling and the proliferation of glioblastoma stem cells. The proneural-mesenchymal transition has been identified as a significant predictor of poor survival in TCGA patients. Furthermore, biomarkers such as PPARγ and STAT3 can be used to identify therapeutic targets and predict disease outcomes. In xenograft models, ligand activation of PPARγ was shown to promote tumor growth and reduce overall survival. Biostatistical analysis of REMBRANDT patients revealed a significant association between PPARγ expression and reduced overall survival, highlighting the potential of PPARγ as a prognostic biomarker. Therefore, targeting PPARγ may be a promising therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma treatment.

Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and lethal form of brain tumors, characterized by their rapid growth and high propensity for recurrence. Despite the limited understanding of the underlying biology, glioblastomas have been classified into distinct subtypes, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal.

Using biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets, we show that PPARγ expression is associated with improved overall and disease-free survival. Our findings suggest that targeting PPARγ could serve as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma patients, particularly those with the proneural subtype. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying glioblastoma growth and progression, our study provides a foundation for future therapeutic interventions.	Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer, characterized by its heterogeneous nature and treatment resistance. Recent studies have identified subtypes of GBM, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal, each with distinct genetic signatures and clinical outcomes. The proneural subtype is associated with poor overall survival, while the mesenchymal subtype exhibits higher tumor growth rates. We analyzed patient tissues from the REMBRANDT cohort and TCGA dataset using biostatistical analysis to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Ligand activation of PPARγ was found to inhibit glioblastoma stem cell growth and reduce tumor burden in xenograft models. Our results highlight the potential of PPARγ as a therapeutic target for mesenchymal GBM. Overall survival and disease-free survival rates also improved in treated patients. These findings have implications for the development of targeted therapies for GBM and suggest a new approach to treating this devastating disease.	Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumors, characterized by rapid growth and poor prognosis. Recent studies have identified subtypes of glioblastomas, including proneural, neural, and mesenchymal, each with distinct genetic signatures and clinical outcomes. The proneural subtype is associated with a favorable prognosis, while the mesenchymal subtype is linked to poor survival. Genetic alterations, such as mutations in the TP53 and CDKN2A genes, contribute to the development and progression of glioblastoma. The presence of glioblastoma stem cells, which are thought to be responsible for tumor growth and drug resistance, is a key feature of this malignancy. PPARγ ligand activation has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models. The proneural-mesenchymal transition is a critical process in glioblastoma progression, driven by STAT3 signaling. Biostatistical analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and REMBRANDT datasets revealed distinct genetic signatures for each subtype.

Despite advances in chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim, with a median survival of only 15 months. Subtype classification is essential for understanding glioblastoma biology and developing targeted therapies. We analyzed the genetic signatures and histological subtypes of 1,444 glioblastoma patients from the TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The proneural subtype was found to have a poorer overall survival and disease-free survival compared to the mesenchymal subtype. Notably, PPARγ ligand activation induced the proneural-mesenchymal transition, promoting tumor growth in xenograft models. Our biostatistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between STAT3 signaling and overall survival. These findings provide new insights into glioblastoma subtypes and their underlying biology, and suggest the potential use of PPARγ ligand activation as a therapeutic strategy to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant form of primary brain cancer, characterized by genetic heterogeneity and complex subtypes. The proneural and classical subtypes, previously thought to be mutually exclusive, have been shown to coexist in the same tumors, exhibiting a proneural-mesenchymal transition. This transition is mediated by ligand activation of STAT3 signaling, leading to increased tumor growth and drug resistance. Our analysis of patient tissues from the REMBRANDT and TCGA datasets revealed that high expression of PPARγ is associated with improved overall and disease-free survival. PPARγ serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment, particularly in mesenchymal tumors.

Title: A Systems Biology Approach to Understanding the Proneural-Mesenchymal Transition in Glioblastoma: Implications for Drug Resistance and Therapeutic Targeting Abstract: Glioblastoma is a heterogeneous tumor type, characterized by distinct subtypes, including proneural, neural, and classical, which exhibit unique genetic signatures and drug resistance profiles. The proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) represents a critical transition in glioblastoma progression, enabling tumor growth and metastasis. This transition is driven by genetic alterations, including activation of STAT3 signaling and dysregulation of PPARγ. Our systems biology approach integrates xenograft models, patient tissues, and TCGA datasets to investigate the PMT in glioblastoma. We identify PPARγ as a potential therapeutic target, which enhances	Glioblastomas are heterogeneous brain tumors with distinct subtypes characterized by varying genetic signatures, clinical outcomes, and responses to therapies. The proneural subtype is known for its relatively better prognosis, while the mesenchymal subtype is more aggressive and resistant to conventional treatments. We investigated the proneural-mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma stem cells and its association with the activation of PPARγ ligands, STAT3 signaling, and the mesenchymal subtype. Using xenograft models, we showed that the mesenchymal subtype exhibits higher tumor growth and poor survival outcomes. Our results indicate that PPARγ ligands may serve as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma, and that STAT3 signaling plays a key role in the proneural-mesenchymal transition. Our findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma.

Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumors, characterized by a heterogeneous genetic landscape and diverse subtypes. The proneural, neural, and classical subtypes, distinguished by their distinct genetic signatures and molecular profiles, exhibit varying clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses. Recent studies have shed light on the transition from a proneural to a mesenchymal phenotype, a hallmark of the aggressive mesenchymal subtype. This transition is mediated by ligand activation of STAT3 signaling, leading to the activation of mesenchymal genes and the suppression of neural and proneural genes. The identification of genetic signatures and biomarkers, such as PPARγ, has facilitated the development of therapeutic strategies. The development of xenograft models and biostatistical analysis has enabled researchers to investigate the clinical implications of these subtypes and the effects of various treatments on tumor growth and survival. This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of genetic signatures and biomarkers in glioblastoma patients and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the mesenchymal subtype. The findings of this study were validated using the TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets.

Recent studies have identified subtypes with distinct genetic signatures, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. The proneural subtype is characterized by PPARγ overexpression and is associated with better overall survival. However, its treatment is often hampered by drug resistance. Our study aimed to investigate the PPARγ-mediated mesenchymal-to-proneural transition (MPT) in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). We used xenograft models and biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets to explore the role of PPARγ activation in STAT3 signaling and glioblastoma progression.

Here is the abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor in adults, characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. Recent studies have identified distinct subtypes of GBM, including proneural, neural, and classical subtypes, each associated with unique genetic signatures, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes. A key challenge in GBM treatment is the identification of reliable biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting. We investigated the PPARγ ligand activation pathway in glioblastoma stem cells, revealing a novel biomarker for GBM and identifying PPARγ as a potential therapeutic target for treating GBM. Our results also showed that proneural-mesenchymal transition contributes to tumor growth and drug resistance. Furthermore, our xenograft models and biostatistical analysis revealed that high expression of the PPARγ ligand activation pathway is associated with improved overall and disease-free survival. Overall, this study highlights the importance of PPARγ ligand activation pathway in GBM and provides new insights into the therapeutic targeting of glioblastoma stem cells and PPARγ, with potential implications for improving patient outcomes.	Glioblastomas, a heterogeneous group of aggressive brain tumors, arise from the expansion of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Recent studies have identified subtypes of glioblastomas, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes, each exhibiting distinct genetic signatures, drug resistance, and tumor growth characteristics. We used REMBRANDT and TCGA datasets to identify proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) as a novel mechanism underlying the development of mesenchymal subtype glioblastomas. We demonstrated that activation of PPARγ by ligand binding triggers PMT, promoting tumor growth and drug resistance. In xenograft models, PPARγ activation significantly reduced overall survival and increased tumor burden. Using biostatistical analysis, we identified STAT3 signaling as a key upstream regulator of PPARγ activation. These findings suggest PPARγ as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. Our results have implications for the development of personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients. Survival and disease-free survival rates for glioblastoma patients vary significantly across subtypes and are influenced by PMT and STAT3 signaling. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and reducing tumor burden in glioblastoma patients.	Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumors in humans, characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity and a propensity for rapid progression. Recent studies have identified three major subtypes of glioblastoma: proneural, neural, and classical, each with distinct genetic signatures and molecular mechanisms that underlie their unique pathogenesis and treatment responses. The proneural subtype is the most common and has been associated with a better prognosis, while the classical and mesenchymal subtypes are more aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy. A key challenge in glioblastoma treatment is the development of targeted therapies that can effectively combat the tumor's inherent drug resistance. PPARγ, a nuclear receptor that regulates lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, has been implicated in the regulation of glioblastoma growth and survival. Activation of PPARγ ligands has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. The identification of biomarkers for the proneural-mesenchymal transition, a process in which glioblastoma stem cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics, is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of tumor progression and for developing effective therapeutic strategies. We present a biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets, which reveals a distinct	Abstract: Glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain cancer, remains a significant clinical challenge due to its high recurrence rate and drug resistance. Recent studies have identified distinct subtypes, including proneural, neural, and classical, which exhibit varying genetic signatures and therapeutic responses. The proneural subtype is characterized by genetic alterations in the PTEN and PDCD4 genes, and is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and poorer overall survival. In contrast, the mesenchymal subtype exhibits increased resistance to conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapies. A novel PPARγ ligand, PPARγ-R1155, has been shown to selectively target glioblastoma stem cells and inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models. Our study employed biostatistical analysis of TCGA data and the REMBRANDT glioblastoma dataset to identify PPARγ-R1155 as a promising therapeutic target, with significant improvements in overall survival and disease-free survival in patient tissues. These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma, focusing on the activation of PPARγ ligands to selectively target glioblastoma stem cells and inhibit tumor growth.	Glioblastomas are aggressive and malignant brain tumors with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Subtypes of glioblastomas have been identified, including proneural, neural, and classical, each exhibiting distinct genetic signatures and clinical behaviors. The proneural subtype, often associated with better prognosis, is characterized by high levels of PPARγ and a low expression of STAT3 signaling. In contrast, the classical subtype, linked to poor prognosis, shows reduced PPARγ and elevated STAT3 signaling. A study using xenograft models and TCGA data from over 500 patients demonstrated that proneural-mesenchymal transition is a critical factor in the development of drug resistance in glioblastoma. Furthermore, we identified a novel biomarker for the classical subtype, which correlated with reduced overall and disease-free survival.

Glioblastoma is a complex and heterogeneous disease characterized by its poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Recent studies have identified subtypes of glioblastomas, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal, which exhibit distinct genetic signatures and molecular profiles. The proneural subtype is associated with better prognosis and is characterized by high expression of neural genes and mesenchymal genes. In contrast, the mesenchymal subtype is associated with worse prognosis and is characterized by high expression of mesenchymal genes and low expression of neural genes. These subtypes undergo a proneural-mesenchymal transition, which is regulated by STAT3 signaling and is associated with drug resistance and poor survival. This transition is also characterized by the activation of PPARγ ligands, which promote tumor growth and proliferation. Our study used xenograft models to investigate the effects of PPARγ ligand activation on glioblastoma stem cells and tumor growth in patient tissues. We found that activation of PPARγ ligands increased tumor growth and survival, and that this effect was associated with the proneural-mesenchymal transition and STAT3 signaling. Our results suggest that PPARγ ligand activation may serve as a biomarker for glioblastoma stem cells and a therapeutic target for the treatment of glioblastoma.	The study investigates the subtypes of glioblastomas, a highly aggressive and heterogeneous brain tumor. We analyzed genetic signatures from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the REMBRANDT glioblastoma dataset, identifying proneural and mesenchymal subtypes. Notably, the proneural subtype exhibits increased expression of PPARγ, a known biomarker for therapeutic targeting. We also observed that glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) can undergo ligand activation-induced, mesenchymal-to-neural transition (MNT), which is associated with increased tumor growth and drug resistance. Our biostatistical analysis reveals that proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) is a significant predictor of overall and disease-free survival. Xenograft models further support the prognostic value of PMT, as tumor burden and STAT3 signaling activation were significantly increased in PMT-positive tumors. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting PPARγ in glioblastoma, particularly in patients with PMT-positive tumors. By integrating genetic signatures and tumor biology, our study provides new insights into the complex biology of glioblastoma and informs the development of personalized therapies.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors characterized by their heterogeneous subtypes and poor overall survival. The proneural and neural subtypes exhibit distinct molecular signatures and clinical behaviors.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant brain tumors, with limited treatment options and poor patient outcomes. We investigated the subtypes of glioblastoma, including proneural, neural, and mesenchymal, and their relationship to genetic signatures, drug resistance, and therapeutic targets. Our results showed that the mesenchymal subtype is characterized by activation of STAT3 signaling and PPARγ, leading to increased tumor growth and resistance to chemotherapy. Notably, proneural-mesenchymal transition, a process driven by STAT3 signaling, significantly affects glioblastoma stem cells and tumor burden. We identified PPARγ as a potential therapeutic target and ligand activation, which may improve overall survival and disease-free survival in glioblastoma patients. Our findings were validated using xenograft models and biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets. These results have important implications for the development of personalized therapies for glioblastoma patients.	The abstract states: The proneural subtype of glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by a distinct genetic signature and is known for aggressive tumor behavior. Here, we investigated the role of PPARγ as a potential biomarker for identifying a specific subtype of GBM, which we termed "proneural-mesenchymal transition" (PMT). Using xenograft models and biostatistical analysis of TCGA data, we identified that PMT GBM exhibits distinct genetic and epigenetic signatures that are associated with drug resistance and poor overall survival. We also found that PPARγ is a key regulator of PMT GBM progression, and its ligand activation leads to STAT3 signaling and enhanced tumor growth. Notably, our xenograft models revealed that targeting PPARγ can significantly reduce tumor growth and improve survival rates. Our findings suggest that PPARγ may serve as a therapeutic target for PMT GBM and potentially for GBM subtypes prone to mesenchymal transition, highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these aggressive subtypes. This work provides valuable insights into the molecular basis of PMT GBM and underscores the potential for PPARγ-based therapeutic strategies in glioblastoma treatment.	Abstract: Glioblastomas, the most aggressive form of brain cancer, exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, with distinct subtypes defined by molecular signatures, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. A subset of glioblastomas, termed mesenchymal glioblastoma (MES GBM), is characterized by a specific genetic signature and exhibits resistance to conventional therapies. Recent studies have identified PPARγ as a potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma, with ligand activation leading to inhibition of tumor growth. In this study, we employed a xenograft model to investigate the role of PPARγ in mesenchymal glioblastoma, with biostatistical analysis using TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets. We found that PPARγ inhibition significantly reduced tumor growth and improved overall and disease-free survival in both human patient tissues and xenograft models. Moreover, proneural-mesenchymal transition was observed in glioblastoma stem cells upon PPARγ inhibition, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy. Our findings provide a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for mesenchymal glioblastoma, and highlight the importance of STAT3 signaling in tumor growth.	Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors characterized by genetic heterogeneity and diverse subtypes. The proneural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes are three major classifications. Recent studies have focused on genetic signatures that distinguish these subtypes and identify potential therapeutic targets. PPARγ, a nuclear receptor, has been shown to promote glioblastoma stem cells and enhance tumor growth in xenograft models. A ligand activation strategy targeting PPARγ could provide a novel therapeutic approach. We analyzed patient tissues from TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets to investigate the prognostic value of PPARγ expression and its relationship with clinical outcomes. Our biostatistical analysis revealed that PPARγ expression was significantly associated with overall and disease-free survival. These results suggest that PPARγ could be a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment, particularly in combination with STAT3 signaling inhibition. Proneural-mesenchymal transition was observed in glioblastoma stem cells treated with PPARγ ligand activation, and tumor growth was reduced in xenograft models. These findings support the potential of PPARγ targeting as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma treatment.

The proneural subtype is associated with better prognosis, whereas the mesenchymal subtype is more aggressive. Understanding the genetic signatures and potential therapeutic targets of glioblastoma subtypes is crucial for developing effective treatments. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PPARγ ligand activation and glioblastoma stem cell self-renewal. We found that ligand activation of PPARγ significantly reduced tumor growth and increased survival in xenograft models. Moreover, we identified a novel biomarker, a specific gene expression signature, that could predict drug resistance and overall survival. Our results suggest that PPARγ ligand activation may be a valuable therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. Additionally, we demonstrated that glioblastoma stem cells undergo proneural-mesenchymal transition in response to PPARγ ligand activation, which may contribute to tumor growth and drug resistance.

The subtypes of glioblastomas are heterogeneously divided into proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes, which exhibit distinct genetic signatures, drug resistance, and clinical outcomes. Proneural glioblastomas, characterized by the expression of neural genes and the presence of glioblastoma stem cells, are known for their poor prognosis and drug resistance. Recent studies have suggested that the proneural subtype is undergoing a proneural-mesenchymal transition, marked by the activation of STAT3 signaling and the ligand activation of PPARγ. This transition is associated with increased tumor growth and reduced overall survival. We employed a REMBRANDT cohort and utilized biostatistical analysis to investigate the clinical outcomes of proneural glioblastoma patients. The results showed that proneural-mesenchymal transition is significantly associated with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. Moreover, the expression of PPARγ and STAT3 signaling was correlated with tumor burden and increased survival in MES GBM xenograft models.

Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumors in adults, characterized by their heterogeneous composition and subtypes, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes. The mesenchymal subtype, characterized by a distinct genetic signature and the expression of mesenchymal markers, is particularly resistant to current therapies and associated with poor patient outcomes.

Among these subtypes, the proneural and classical subtypes are the most prevalent, while the mesenchymal subtype is more aggressive and resistant to treatment. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of genetic signatures in defining these subtypes and predicting treatment response. The PPARγ ligand, 15-DEET, has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models by targeting glioblastoma stem cells and inducing a proneural-mesenchymal transition. This study employed biostatistical analysis and TCGA data to investigate the prognostic value of 15-DEET as a biomarker for overall and disease-free survival in patients with glioblastoma, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.

We utilized TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets to identify biomarkers associated with overall and disease-free survival. Our results indicate that PPARγ activation is a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma stem cells and that ligand activation can promote tumor growth in xenograft models. Furthermore, we found that proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) is a significant biomarker for predicting patient survival and that STAT3 signaling is involved in this transition. Biostatistical analysis revealed that high tumor burden and poor overall survival were associated with PMT.

The clinical and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma is underscored by its subtyping into proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes. These subtypes exhibit distinct genetic signatures, growth patterns, and responses to therapies. Proneural glioblastomas often exhibit the highest genetic instability and are frequently resistant to conventional chemotherapy. In contrast, classical glioblastomas are more responsive to treatment but possess a more pronounced mesenchymal phenotype, characterized by increased tumor growth and invasion.

Recent studies have identified subtypes of glioblastoma, including the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes, which have distinct genetic signatures and response to treatment. The classical subtype, previously considered a single entity, has now been identified as a heterogeneous population with varying degrees of neural and mesenchymal characteristics. This transition from proneural to mesenchymal, termed proneural-mesenchymal transition, is associated with drug resistance and poor overall survival. PPARγ ligand activation has been shown to suppress tumor growth in xenograft models, and may serve as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma stem cells. This study employed biostatistical analysis using TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets to identify genetic signatures associated with treatment response and survival outcomes in glioblastoma patients.

Recent studies have identified distinct subtypes of glioblastoma, which may be associated with different clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses. Among these subtypes, the proneural and classical subtypes are distinct and have different genetic signatures. However, the mesenchymal subtype exhibits the most resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recent studies have shown that genetic signatures can be used to identify the subtypes of glioblastoma and to predict the response to therapy. In this study, we used xenograft models to investigate the effect of PPARγ ligand activation on glioblastoma stem cells and tumor growth. We found that PPARγ ligand activation inhibited tumor growth and induced the proneural-mesenchymal transition. We also found that PPARγ ligand activation suppressed STAT3 signaling and reduced the tumor burden.

Proneural glioblastomas (PR) are more common and tend to have a better prognosis, while classical glioblastomas (CL) and mesenchymal glioblastomas (MS) are more aggressive. Recent studies have suggested that the proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of glioblastoma. Here, we investigate the genetic signatures, drug resistance, and therapeutic targets of glioblastoma subtypes using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models. We show that PPARγ is a key biomarker for PMT, and its ligand activation inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models. Our biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets reveals that patients with PMT exhibit improved overall survival and disease-free survival compared to those with non-PMT glioblastomas. We also identify STAT3 signaling as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. Our results suggest that targeting PMT and STAT3 signaling may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma treatment.	Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant form of brain tumors, characterized by a heterogeneous population of cells with diverse subtypes, including proneural, neural, and classical. These subtypes have distinct genetic signatures and molecular mechanisms that influence tumor growth and progression. The mesenchymal subtype is particularly aggressive and has been implicated in drug resistance, a major obstacle in glioblastoma therapy. We identified a novel biomarker, PPARγ, which is downregulated in mesenchymal glioblastomas and can be targeted by ligand activation. Our results show that inhibition of STAT3 signaling, a key factor in glioblastoma stem cells, reduces tumor growth in xenograft models. Our analysis of TCGA data and REMBRANDT patient tissues indicates that PPARγ expression is associated with overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. However, the proneural-mesenchymal transition, a process that underlies tumor growth and drug resistance, remains poorly understood.

Our results show that PPARγ ligand activation significantly reduces tumor growth and improves overall survival in both proneural and classical glioblastoma subtypes. Notably, in the proneural subtype, PPARγ ligand activation promotes a mesenchymal-to-neural transition, inhibiting STAT3 signaling. This transition is associated with improved disease-free survival. Biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets confirms the prognostic value of PPARγ ligand activation in glioblastoma subtypes. Our findings suggest that PPARγ ligand activation may serve as a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma, particularly in proneural and classical subtypes.	The presence of the proneural subtype in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is associated with improved overall survival and reduced tumor burden. However, the neural subtype is more frequently linked to drug resistance and poorer outcomes. We investigated the expression of PPARγ in patient tissues from the REMBRANDT and TCGA datasets to identify potential biomarkers for subtyping GBM. Our analysis revealed a significant association between PPARγ expression and the presence of the proneural subtype. Furthermore, we identified a novel subtyping paradigm based on the proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) and STAT3 signaling. Our results indicate that PMT and STAT3 signaling play a crucial role in glioblastoma stem cells and ligand activation, and that PPARγ can serve as a therapeutic target to overcome drug resistance. Our xenograft models and biostatistical analysis also demonstrate improved survival and reduced tumor burden in mice with PPARγ-targeted therapy. These findings have significant implications for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for GBM patients.	Glioblastomas are the most aggressive form of brain cancer, accounting for approximately 15% of all brain tumors. Subtypes of glioblastomas have been identified, and two main subtypes, proneural and classical, are known to have distinct genetic signatures. These signatures have been associated with clinical outcomes, including overall survival and disease-free survival. A key challenge in glioblastoma treatment is the development of drug resistance, particularly in mesenchymal subtypes. Research has shown that PPARγ activation can be a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. The mesenchymal subtype has been shown to undergo proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT), which involves changes in STAT3 signaling pathways. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between PPARγ activation and PMT in glioblastoma stem cells. We used xenograft models to study the effect of PPARγ ligand activation on tumor growth, and we analyzed patient tissues from the REMBRANDT and TCGA databases to identify biomarkers for glioblastoma subtypes.

Proneural glioblastomas are often associated with mesenchymal markers, leading to a proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT). This transition is mediated by STAT3 signaling and ligand activation of PPARγ. A key feature of PMT is the activation of glioblastoma stem cells, leading to enhanced tumor growth and drug resistance. Using xenograft models and TCGA data, we demonstrated that PMT is a significant predictor of poor overall and disease-free survival. Moreover, REMBRANDT data revealed that PPARγ activation is a major driver of PMT. Biostatistical analysis of patient tissues confirmed that high PPARγ expression is associated with reduced overall survival. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting PPARγ in glioblastoma treatment, offering new therapeutic strategies for improving patient outcomes.	Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of brain cancer, characterized by rapid growth and high mortality rates. To better understand its progression, researchers identified specific subtypes of glioblastoma, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. The mesenchymal subtype is particularly aggressive, but also exhibits unique genetic signatures and biomarkers. A novel approach revealed that the mesenchymal subtype is characterized by a proneural-mesenchymal transition, driven by the STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, ligand activation of PPARγ was found to inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models. This study's results, validated by biostatistical analysis using TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets, suggest that PPARγ may serve as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment, potentially improving overall and disease-free survival rates. Moreover, glioblastoma stem cells, which are resistant to current therapies, may be targeted by PPARγ ligand activation, leading to reduced tumor burden and improved patient outcomes.

The mesenchymal subtype is characterized	Glioblastomas are aggressive and malignant brain tumors characterized by their heterogeneous nature and poor prognosis. Recent studies have identified three main subtypes of glioblastoma: proneural, classical, and mesenchymal, which differ significantly in their genetic and molecular profiles. Proneural glioblastomas are typically driven by the activation of neural stem cell transcription factors, whereas classical glioblastomas are characterized by the expression of mesenchymal markers. Mesenchymal glioblastomas, on the other hand, exhibit a more primitive, embryonic-like gene expression profile. These subtypes have distinct clinical outcomes and treatment responses. For example, proneural glioblastomas tend to be more responsive to chemotherapy, while mesenchymal glioblastomas are more resistant. Here, we present a comprehensive study using xenograft models and patient tissues from the REMBRANDT cohort to investigate the genetic signatures and therapeutic targets of glioblastoma subtypes. We found that the proneural subtype is associated with a significant decrease in tumor burden and improved overall survival, whereas the classical and mesenchymal subtypes are associated with poorer survival outcomes. Notably, the PPARγ ligand activation pathway plays a crucial role in glioblastoma stem cell maintenance and tumor growth. Our biostatistical analysis using TCGA	The co-expression of PPARγ and STAT3 signaling pathways in glioblastoma stem cells promotes tumorigenicity and drug resistance. We report the identification of a novel, biostatistically validated biomarker, utilizing the REMBRANDT dataset, that correlates with PPARγ and STAT3 expression and is associated with a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, in xenograft models, we demonstrate that ligand activation of the PPARγ pathway inhibits tumor growth, leading to reduced tumor burden and improved overall and disease-free survival. Our findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy targeting the PPARγ pathway to overcome mesenchymal-proneural transition and drug resistance in glioblastoma, with potential implications for treatment of high-grade glioblastomas with MES GBM subtypes.

Abstract: Glioblastomas (GBMs) are highly malignant and heterogeneous brain tumors with poor prognosis. Recent studies have identified proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes of glioblastomas, each with distinct genetic signatures and therapeutic implications. The presence of glioblastoma stem cells, which are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy, poses a significant challenge in GBM treatment. PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation, metabolism, and survival. Activation of PPARγ by its ligands, such as thiazolidinediones, has been shown to inhibit glioblastoma cell growth and induce apoptosis. We investigated the role of PPARγ ligand activation in glioblastoma stem cells and its potential as a therapeutic target.

Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant brain tumors in adults, characterized by a heterogeneous population of subtypes. Among these subtypes, proneural and mesenchymal glioblastomas exhibit distinct genetic signatures and are associated with distinct clinical outcomes. The classical subtype is the most common and has a poorer prognosis. The transition from proneural to mesenchymal subtypes is mediated by the upregulation of STAT3 signaling and is associated with increased tumor growth and drug resistance. Furthermore, genetic alterations and activation of PPARγ ligands are involved in the transition of glioblastoma stem cells from a neural to a mesenchymal phenotype. This study utilized xenograft models and patient tissues from the REMBRANDT database to investigate the prognostic value of the proneural-mesenchymal transition and its correlation with PPARγ ligand activation. The results showed a significant association between the proneural-mesenchymal transition and decreased overall survival.

Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous tumor, classified into three subtypes: proneural, neural, and classical. The proneural subtype, with distinct genetic signatures and clinical characteristics, exhibits a higher propensity for mesenchymal transition, which is associated with increased drug resistance.

Recent studies have identified the mesenchymal subtype as a novel, more aggressive form of glioblastoma, characterized by the presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and a pronounced neural-mesenchymal transition. GSCs are known to be highly resistant to conventional therapies and are a major contributor to tumor growth, progression, and poor survival rates. In this study, we investigated the effects of ligand activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) on the growth and survival of GSCs, as well as its therapeutic potential in mesenchymal glioblastomas. Our results indicate that PPARγ activation inhibits tumor growth and reduces tumor burden in xenograft models, while also improving overall and disease-free survival in patient tissues. Furthermore, we found that PPARγ is a potent biomarker for identifying mesenchymal glioblastomas, which are characterized by a higher STAT3 signaling pathway activity. These findings suggest that PPARγ activation may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of glioblastomas, particularly for patients with mesenchymal subtypes	Glioblastomas are aggressive and heterogeneous brain tumors characterized by diverse molecular subtypes, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes. The proneural subtype is the most common, but its subtypes' differences in genetic signatures, drug resistance, and therapeutic target PPARγ, remain poorly understood. We analyzed patient tissues using REMBRANDT and TCGA datasets to identify genetic signatures associated with PPARγ expression and its correlation with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Our results showed that GSCs expressing PPARγ were more aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant brain tumors, characterized by their high propensity for subtyping into distinct neuroepithelial and non-neuroepithelial subtypes. Among these subtypes, proneural and classical glioblastomas are well-established, whereas the mesenchymal subtype remains understudied. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of PPARγ as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma, particularly in the mesenchymal subtype. Using genetic signatures and biomarkers, we identified novel therapeutic targets in glioblastoma stem cells, which exhibited increased drug resistance to current treatments. Notably, ligand activation of PPARγ revealed a significant association with tumor growth and overall survival in xenograft models. These findings suggest that proneural-mesenchymal transition, mediated by STAT3 signaling, may serve as a key driver of glioblastoma progression. Our results highlight the need for targeted therapies addressing PPARγ ligand activation and STAT3 signaling in glioblastoma patients. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioblastoma progression and underscores the importance of further research in this area.	Glioblastoma is a devastating and aggressive form of brain cancer characterized by rapid tumor growth and high mortality rates. The heterogeneity of glioblastomas arises from the presence of multiple subtypes, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. Proneural glioblastomas are associated with a distinct genetic signature and higher expression of PPARγ, a biomarker of tumor suppressor activity. However, the classical and mesenchymal subtypes exhibit higher drug resistance and are more prone to proneural-mesenchymal transition, a process driven by STAT3 signaling. A recent biostatistical analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and REMBRANDT datasets revealed that proneural glioblastomas with high PPARγ expression have improved overall survival and disease-free survival compared to classical and mesenchymal subtypes. Xenograft models also showed that ligand activation of PPARγ promotes tumor growth inhibition. The findings suggest that PPARγ activation is a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment, particularly for proneural-mesenchymal transition subtype, and may improve patient survival rates.

Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumors, characterized by their rapid growth and resistance to current treatments. Recent studies have identified distinct subtypes of glioblastomas, which are associated with different genetic signatures, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic responses. Proneural and classical subtypes are more responsive to chemotherapy, while mesenchymal subtype is more resistant. The transition from proneural to mesenchymal is associated with the activation of STAT3 signaling and increased tumor growth.

Note	Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive and malignant primary brain tumor, is characterized by genetic heterogeneity and subtyping. Recent studies have identified three subtypes of glioblastoma: proneural, neural, and classical. However, the mesenchymal subtype is increasingly recognized as a significant entity with distinct genetic signatures and clinical outcomes. The present study aims to investigate the role of PPARγ in glioblastoma and its potential as a biomarker for identifying the proneural-mesenchymal transition. Using xenograft models, we observed that ligand activation of PPARγ promoted tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, we found that STAT3 signaling was involved in the proneural-mesenchymal transition. Our biostatistical analysis of the TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets revealed that low expression of PPARγ was associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. These findings suggest that PPARγ may serve as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma, particularly in the proneural-mesenchymal transition subtype. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of analyzing the interactions between glioblastoma stem cells and their microenvironment in understanding glioblastoma progression.	Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant brain tumors, characterized by diverse subtypes and genetic signatures that influence their behavior and response to treatment. Among the subtypes, the proneural and neural types are typically associated with favorable outcomes, while the classical and mesenchymal types are more aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy. Genetic signatures have been identified that distinguish these subtypes and predict treatment outcomes. For example, the presence of a PPARγ biomarker has been linked to better prognosis. In contrast, glioblastoma stem cells, which are thought to be responsible for tumor relapse, are more resistant to ligand activation of STAT3 signaling pathways. Recent studies have employed xenograft models to investigate the role of proneural-mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma progression. However, the relationship between this transition and treatment outcomes remains unclear.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a primary brain tumor, exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity, making its classification and treatment challenging. Recent studies have identified distinct subtypes of glioblastomas, including proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal. The proneural subtype, characterized by high expression of neuronal markers, often has a better prognosis than the classical and mesenchymal subtypes. However, the mesenchymal subtype, which displays a more aggressive phenotype, is often associated with poor overall survival. A key mechanism underlying the aggressiveness of glioblastomas is their potential to undergo a proneural-mesenchymal transition. The mesenchymal subtype also exhibits genetic signatures and drug resistance, which render it resistant to conventional therapies. Furthermore, the transcription factor STAT3 signaling plays a crucial role in this transition. Our analysis of patient tissues from the TCGA database, as well as xenograft models, revealed a significant association between the presence of glioblastoma stem cells and overall survival. Additionally, ligand activation of PPARγ, a biologically relevant target, showed promise in inhibiting tumor growth. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of understanding the complex subtypes of glioblastoma and their potential therapeutic targets, including the PPARγ pathway. This knowledge can inform the development	Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and malignant brain tumors in adults, characterized by high genetic heterogeneity and poor overall survival rates.

Our study highlights the importance of	The molecular and genetic characteristics of glioblastomas are heterogeneous, and subtyping of glioblastomas based on clinical and pathological features has been a topic of increasing interest. Here, we investigated the subtypes of glioblastomas, particularly the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes, and their relationship to the classical subtype, through a comprehensive analysis of genomic data and xenograft models in a REMBRANDT glioma database. Our results showed that glioblastoma stem cells exhibit strong PPARγ activation, which promotes tumor growth and drug resistance. A proneural-mesenchymal transition was observed, and STAT3 signaling was significantly upregulated in the mesenchymal subtype. We used biostatistical analysis to validate our findings in the TCGA database and showed that the proneural subtype had a higher overall survival rate compared to the mesenchymal subtype. Furthermore, a multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the expression of PPARγ and the presence of glioblastoma stem cells were independent predictive factors for survival. These findings suggest that PPARγ and glioblastoma stem cells may serve as therapeutic targets for glioblastoma treatment. Additionally, our results provide a basis for developing novel biomarkers for glioblastoma diagnosis and for predicting treatment outcomes. Our study demonstrates the importance of understanding the	Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Recent studies have identified two main subtypes of glioblastoma: proneural and classical.

Recent studies have identified distinct subtypes, including the proneural, neural, and classical subtypes, which exhibit varying clinical outcomes and responses to treatment. The mesenchymal subtype is characterised by a more aggressive phenotype and poor survival rates. Genetic signatures and biomarkers, such as PPARγ and STAT3 signalling, have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. The proneural-mesenchymal transition, driven by ligand activation, plays a critical role in tumour growth and drug resistance. This study employed biostatistical analysis and xenograft models to investigate the impact of these subtypes and biomarkers on overall and disease-free survival in patients with GBM, with implications for developing targeted therapies. The results showed that the proneural subtype exhibited improved overall survival, while the mesenchymal subtype was associated with poor disease-free survival. Furthermore, the TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets were used to validate our findings. Overall, this study highlights the potential of using genetic signatures and biomarkers to identify and target specific subtypes of GBM, with the goal of improving patient outcomes and survival.	Glioblastoma is a devastating and aggressive form of brain cancer with a poor prognosis. The subtypes of glioblastomas, classified into proneural, neural, and classical subtypes, have distinct genetic signatures, phenotypic characteristics, and clinical behaviors. While PPARγ activation has shown promise as a therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance in glioblastoma stem cells, its efficacy in tumor growth and patient survival remains to be elucidated. Here, we employed xenograft models to investigate the effects of PPARγ ligand activation on glioblastoma growth and survival in patient tissues. The results showed significant inhibition of tumor growth and improved survival in proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) subtype glioblastoma, but not in classical glioblastoma. Our biostatistical analysis revealed that STAT3 signaling is significantly correlated with overall survival and disease-free survival in both subtypes. The findings suggest that PPARγ ligand activation is a potential therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma, particularly in PMT subtype glioblastoma, and highlight the importance of biomarker identification and biostatistical analysis in glioblastoma research.

Abstract: Glioblastomas, the most aggressive form of brain cancer, exhibit a heterogeneous mix of subtypes, including proneural, neural, and classical. Genetic signatures, such as the MES GBM subtype, play a crucial role in defining these subtypes and predicting patient outcomes. The subtypes also display distinct responses to drugs and exhibit varying levels of drug resistance.

Our results suggest that this transition is associated with reduced overall and disease-free survival, and highlight PPARγ as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. By integrating biostatistical analysis, we validated the prognostic value of PPARγ in independent patient cohorts, further emphasizing its potential as a biomarker for glioblastoma treatment response.	Abstract: Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors characterized by heterogeneous subtypes, which can significantly influence treatment outcomes. The proneural and classical subtypes exhibit distinct genetic signatures, with the former associated with increased expression of neural and mesenchymal genes. In contrast, the mesenchymal subtype displays a mesenchymal-proneural transition. We investigated the relationship between PPARγ signaling and glioblastoma stem cells in the context of MES GBM, a subtype characterized by mesenchymal and proneural features. Through biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets, we identified PPARγ as a potential biomarker for therapeutic targeting. Moreover, ligand activation of PPARγ led to decreased tumor growth in xenograft models. These findings suggest that PPARγ inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma patients, particularly those with mesenchymal-proneural subtypes. The implications of our study are supported by high patient survival rates following treatment with PPARγ agonists. Overall, our research highlights the potential of PPARγ as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma stem cells and tumor growth, with significant implications for patient outcomes.

Abstract: Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most aggressive and malignant primary brain tumors, with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Recent studies have identified distinct subtypes of GBMs, including proneural, neural, and classical subtypes, each with unique genetic signatures and clinical characteristics. The proneural subtype is characterized by high expression of neural genes and poor prognosis. The classical subtype is associated with mesenchymal markers and resistance to chemotherapy.

Many of these young fathers have experienced significant life disruptions, including emotional distress, substance use, and sentinel events, including the loss of a parent. These life events have contributed to the formation of their identity as fathers and influenced their perceptions of fatherhood. The study found that despite the challenges, these young fathers reported positive perceptions of fatherhood and a meaningful life, and were able to form strong family relationships despite the adversity.	The concept of fatherhood and its effects on Hispanic adolescent fathers is a relatively understudied area, particularly among underrepresented populations. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted among 30 Hispanic adolescent fathers, aged 15-19 years, who had recently experienced a sentinel event (e.g., a child's arrest or injury). Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore their experiences, perceptions, and relationships with family and community. The data revealed that the adolescent fathers were exposed to critical life events, including racism, discrimination, and neighborhood violence, which contributed to their emotional distress and substance use. However, some participants reported positive perceptions of fatherhood and meaningful life experiences. The findings highlight the need for community-based programs to address the unique challenges faced by this population and promote positive life outcomes.	Hispanic adolescents who become fathers early in life are disproportionately represented in the community-based program "Familia Fuerte" (Strong Family). Despite being underrepresented in the program's quantitative data, we found that these early fatherhood experiences significantly impacted the adolescent fathers' perceptions of fatherhood, family relationships, and overall well-being. Semi-structured interviews revealed the complex interplay between critical life events, such as racism, discrimination, neighborhood violence, and substance use, with fatherhood experiences. Life course theory guided our analysis, highlighting the long-term effects of these early life events on adolescent fathers' emotional distress, grief, and resilience. Our findings underscore the importance of acknowledging and addressing the underrepresentation of Hispanic adolescent fathers in the program's data and highlight the need for culturally tailored support services to mitigate the adverse effects of these critical life events.	Hispanic adolescents are underrepresented in research on fatherhood, and as a result, their experiences and perspectives are not fully understood. This qualitative descriptive study aimed to explore the experiences of Hispanic adolescent fathers, exploring how life course events, such as critical life events, influenced their perceptions of fatherhood and their family relationships. Utilizing semi-structured interviews, the study sought to understand the ways in which Hispanic adolescent fathers navigated grief, substance use, and emotional distress. Findings revealed that despite experiencing significant challenges, these young men maintained positive perceptions of fatherhood and had meaningful relationships with their children. However, racism, discrimination, and neighborhood violence were common sentinel events that impacted their lives and fatherhood experiences. A community-based program was established to support these young men and their families. This study highlights the need for culturally sensitive interventions that address the unique challenges faced by Hispanic adolescent fathers.	Hispanic adolescents who become fathers are at risk for a range of negative outcomes. Life course theory suggests that experiences in early life, including those associated with fatherhood, can have lasting effects on an individual's life trajectory. This qualitative descriptive study examined the experiences of Hispanic adolescent fathers who participated in a community-based program designed to support their transition to fatherhood. Semi-structured interviews with 15 participants revealed that while some participants experienced positive perceptions of fatherhood and meaningful life, others reported critical life events, such as racism, discrimination, and neighborhood violence, that negatively impacted their well-being. The study highlights the need for targeted support programs that address the intersection of racism, discrimination, and neighborhood violence in promoting healthy development among underrepresented Hispanic adolescent fathers.

Abstract: Ceramides, sphingolipids derived from sphingosine, play significant roles in endothelial functions and cardiovascular health. Specifically, plasma ceramides are elevated in individuals with cardiovascular diseases and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the role of Sptlc2, a sphingolipid transporter, in regulating ceramide levels and endothelial function in mice. Our results show that Sptlc2 expression is decreased in the diseased endothelium, leading to increased ceramide levels, eNOS phosphorylation, and diminished NO-mediated vasodilation. NO agonists enhanced Sptlc2 expression and ceramide metabolism, leading to improved endothelial function and blood pressure homeostasis. These findings suggest that Sptlc2 and ceramide metabolism play critical roles in vascular tone regulation and highlight the potential of ceramide metabolism modulation as a therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases.	Ceramide signaling pathways are increasingly recognized as playing significant roles in maintaining vascular tone regulation and blood pressure homeostasis. Here, we investigate the role of Sptlc2-mediated ceramide biosynthesis in endothelial functions. We found that ceramide signaling activates the eNOS phosphorylation pathway, leading to NO production and subsequent vasodilation. This effect was dependent on the presence of NO agonists and the specific ceramides C16:0-Cer, C24:0-Cer, and C24:1-Cer. Moreover, the GPCRs coupled to these ceramides also played a crucial role in regulating vascular tone.

Abstract: Ceramides, the most abundant sphingolipid family, have emerged as crucial regulators of endothelial functions and cardiovascular health. We investigated the role of Sptlc2, the primary enzyme involved in ceramide biosynthesis, in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure homeostasis. C16:0-Cer, C24:0-Cer, and C24:1-Cer, three prominent ceramides, induced endothelial dysfunction and increased blood pressure in mouse models. However, Sptlc2-mediated ceramide suppression abolished these effects, and NO agonists enhanced eNOS phosphorylation, leading to vasodilation and improved blood pressure homeostasis. Our findings suggest that GPCRs and endothelial biosynthesis play key roles in regulating vascular tone and that plasma ceramide levels are a significant risk factor for major cardiovascular events. The diseased endothelium, characterized by reduced ceramide biosynthesis and increased ceramide levels, is a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction and contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Ceramides, a subclass of sphingolipids, have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, elevated plasma levels of ceramides, particularly C16:0-Cer, C24:0-Cer, and C24:1-Cer, have been associated with endothelial dysfunction and a higher risk of major cardiovascular events. These ceramides inhibit endothelial functions, including vasodilation, and disrupt vascular tone regulation through the inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation, a key mechanism in the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator. The Sptlc2 gene plays a crucial role in regulating ceramide synthesis and its effects on endothelial functions, further highlighting its importance in cardiovascular health.

Abstract: Ceramides, a subclass of sphingolipids, play a crucial role in the regulation of endothelial functions. Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 2 (Sptlc2) catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramides to produce ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and free sphingosine.

Ceramides and Sphingolipids: The Endothelial Pathway and Blood Pressure Homeostasis Abstract: Ceramides, a subset of sphingolipids, have been implicated in the regulation of endothelial functions and blood pressure homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of Sptlc2 in the biosynthesis of C16:0-Cer, C24:0-Cer, and C24:1-Cer, which are significant contributors to plasma ceramide levels. These ceramides act as NO agonists, inducing eNOS phosphorylation and subsequent vasodilation. However, excessive levels of plasma ceramides, particularly C16:0-Cer and C24:1-Cer, can disrupt endothelial function and contribute to elevated blood pressure. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, ceramides can also promote vascular tone regulation, leading to major cardiovascular events. Our study aimed to elucidate the role of ceramides in endothelial biosynthesis and their impact on blood pressure homeostasis, providing insights into the pathogenesis of diseased endothelium and potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease management.	Ceramides have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases due to their role in disrupting endothelial functions, a key component in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis. Here, we investigate the impact of ceramides on endothelial functions and vascular tone regulation. We show that plasma ceramides, particularly C16:0-Cer and C24:0-Cer, are associated with major cardiovascular events. Our results also demonstrate that ceramides inhibit eNOS phosphorylation, a critical step in NO-mediated vasodilation, thereby impairing endothelial function. Moreover, we identify Sptlc2 as a key sphingolipid biosynthetic enzyme involved in ceramide generation and endothelial dysfunction. Our findings provide insight into the role of ceramides in cardiovascular diseases and suggest that targeting ceramide synthesis or modulating ceramide signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy.	Ceramides, a family of sphingolipids, play a critical role in endothelial functions, influencing blood pressure homeostasis and vascular tone regulation. Sphingolipid phosphatase 2 (Sptlc2) is a key enzyme in ceramide biosynthesis, while ceramides themselves can modulate endothelial cell signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The effects of ceramides on endothelial functions are complex and context-dependent.
