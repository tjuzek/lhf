Identification of a PPARγ-dependent biomarker for drug resistance in glioblastoma subtypes Background: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive form of brain cancer, with limited treatment options due to drug resistance. The proneural and mesenchymal subtypes have been characterized by distinct genetic signatures, but the underlying mechanisms driving drug resistance remain poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed patient tissues from the REMBRANDT and TCGA cohorts to identify a PPARγ-dependent biomarker for drug resistance in glioblastoma subtypes.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of primary brain cancer, with a poor prognosis. Recent studies have identified two major subtypes of GBM: proneural and mesenchymal.

The proneural subtype is often associated with high tumor growth rates, poor survival rates, and poor response to conventional chemotherapy. The classical subtype, in contrast, tends to have a more favorable prognosis and better response to treatment. The mesenchymal subtype, characterized by the expression of mesenchymal markers, exhibits aggressive tumor behavior and poor response to conventional therapies. The genetic signature of the proneural subtype is associated with PPARγ, a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. The STAT3 signaling pathway is also implicated in the proneural subtype, contributing to drug resistance. A biostatistical analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT datasets reveals that the proneural subtype is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. The proneural-mesenchymal transition is a hallmark of glioblastoma progression, and is characterized by the ligand activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. This transition is associated with tumor growth and a higher tumor burden in xenograft models. Understanding the proneural subtype and its associated therapeutic targets is crucial for the development of effective treatments for glioblastoma.

Proneural subtype glioblastoma cells exhibited higher expression of PPARγ and were more susceptible to ligand activation, promoting tumor growth. Conversely, classical subtype glioblastoma cells exhibited increased expression of the STAT3 signaling pathway, associated with higher tumor burden and reduced overall and disease-free survival.

Glioblastomas, a type of brain cancer, exhibit diverse subtypes with distinct genetic signatures. Among these subtypes, proneural and classical glioblastomas are recognized for their unique molecular features, whereas mesenchymal glioblastomas are often associated with aggressive tumor behavior. The proneural-mesenchymal transition (PMT) represents a pivotal event in the progression of glioblastoma, marked by the activation of STAT3 signaling and ligand-induced activation of PPARγ. This transition is characterized by an increase in tumor growth and a decrease in patient survival. This study aims to investigate the role of PMT in glioblastoma progression and explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

Ceramides, sphingolipids derived from sphingosine, play significant roles in endothelial functions and cardiovascular health. Specifically, plasma ceramides are elevated in individuals with cardiovascular diseases and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the role of Sptlc2, a sphingolipid transporter, in regulating ceramide levels and endothelial function in mice. Our results show that Sptlc2 expression is decreased in the diseased endothelium, leading to increased ceramide levels, eNOS phosphorylation, and diminished NO-mediated vasodilation. NO agonists enhanced Sptlc2 expression and ceramide metabolism, leading to improved endothelial function and blood pressure homeostasis. These findings suggest that Sptlc2 and ceramide metabolism play critical roles in vascular tone regulation and highlight the potential of ceramide metabolism modulation as a therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases.	Ceramide signaling pathways are increasingly recognized as playing significant roles in maintaining vascular tone regulation and blood pressure homeostasis. We investigate the role of Sptlc2-mediated ceramide biosynthesis in endothelial functions.

We found that glutamine supplementation enhanced tumour growth, reduced αKG levels, and increased hypomethylation at H3K4me3 marks. These changes correlated with increased expression of oncogenic pathways and a decrease in tumour cell survival rates following BRAF inhibitor treatment. Our results indicate that dietary intervention with glutamine supplementation may enhance tumour growth and resistance to targeted therapies in melanoma.	Tumour cells exhibit decreased responsiveness to nutrient deprivation in melanoma, but supplementation with glutamine is less effective in inhibiting tumour growth compared to other nutrients.

Melanoma cells exhibit a high demand for glutamine, which is often limited under nutrient-deprived conditions. Glutamine supplementation was found to enhance tumour growth and survival in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, metabolomic analysis revealed increased αKG levels, indicative of enhanced glutaminolysis. BRAF inhibitor treatment showed no significant impact on tumour growth. Hypomethylation of H3K4me3 was observed in tumour cells subjected to glutamine supplementation. These findings suggest that glutamine supplementation may be an effective dietary intervention to modulate oncogenic pathways and tumour growth, and that epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in the response to glutamine supplementation. A targeted therapy strategy incorporating glutamine supplementation may be a promising approach for the treatment of melanoma.	The tumour microenvironment of melanoma patients is characterized by a state of chronic nutrient deprivation, which hampers tumour growth and survival. Glutamine supplementation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to support tumour cell metabolism. Using a transgenic mouse model of BRAF-mutant melanoma, we investigated the effects of glutamine supplementation on tumour growth and survival in response to a dietary intervention with a low α-ketoglutarate (αKG) content. Our metabolomic analysis revealed that glutamine supplementation increased αKG levels, which in turn triggered a reduction in tumour growth and an increase in survival. We also found that glutamine supplementation led to hypomethylation of the tumour genome, resulting in increased expression of oncogenic pathways. Notably, the supplementation of BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, enhanced the tumour suppressive effects of glutamine supplementation. Our study demonstrates that glutamine supplementation can act as a targeted therapy to support tumour cell survival and growth in a BRAF-mutant melanoma model, and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for dietary intervention.	The role of glutamine supplementation in tumour growth and survival in melanoma was investigated using a transgenic mouse model that expresses the BRAF V600E mutation. The mice were divided into two groups: one received glutamine supplementation and the other received a BRAF inhibitor. The mice in the glutamine group showed increased tumour growth and survival, while those in the BRAF inhibitor group showed suppressed tumour growth. The transcriptome and metabolomic analysis of the tumour cells revealed significant changes in gene expression and metabolism in the glutamine group, including upregulation of αKG and downregulation of H3K4me3. These changes were associated with hypomethylation of the promoter regions of oncogenic genes and activation of the mTOR pathway. Dietary intervention with glutamine supplementation could serve as a targeted therapy for melanoma treatment, potentially overcoming resistance to targeted therapies. The findings highlight the importance of glutamine metabolism in tumour growth and survival in melanoma.	Tumour cells under nutrient deprivation exhibit increased susceptibility to glutamine supplementation, leading to enhanced tumour growth and survival. In a transgenic mouse model of melanoma, glutamine supplementation promotes tumour growth and is associated with changes in the transcriptome and metabolomic profile. BRAF inhibition enhances the sensitivity of tumour cells to glutamine supplementation, and this is accompanied by decreased levels of αKG and increased levels of H3K4me3, indicative of epigenetic modifications. Moreover, glutamine supplementation promotes hypomethylation, disrupting oncogenic pathways and leading to enhanced tumour growth and survival. Dietary intervention with glutamine may provide a targeted therapeutic strategy for melanoma treatment.	Tumour cells rely heavily on nutrient deprivation, particularly glutamine supplementation, to promote tumour growth and survival. In a transgenic mouse model, glutamine supplementation enhanced tumour growth and survival in melanoma-bearing mice. BRAF inhibitor treatment suppressed tumour growth but not glutamine supplementation. Metabolomic analysis and transcriptome analysis revealed that tumour cells exhibit hypomethylation of H3K4me3 and increased αKG levels, which are associated with oncogenic pathways. Dietary intervention and targeted therapy are potential avenues for developing effective treatments for melanoma.	Tumour cells in melanoma exhibit a high demand for glutamine, a condition known as glutamine addiction, which is linked to nutrient deprivation. In this study, we used a transgenic mouse model to investigate the role of glutamine supplementation in tumour growth and survival. The results showed that glutamine supplementation inhibited tumour growth, increased survival, and reduced αKG levels, a key metabolite in the Krebs cycle.

The effects of glutamine supplementation on tumour growth and survival in a transgenic mouse model of melanoma are investigated. The model is characterised by activating mutations in the BRAF gene, a common genetic alteration in melanoma. Following 14 days of treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, glutamine supplementation was administered to mice. Tumour growth and survival were assessed over 28 days. Glutamine supplementation was associated with increased tumour growth, increased α-ketoglutarate (αKG) levels, and alterations in the transcriptome. Metabolomic analysis revealed increased histone H3K4me3 and reduced H3K27me3. These findings suggest that glutamine supplementation supports tumour growth, possibly by activating oncogenic pathways and promoting epigenetic modifications.

Importantly, BRAF inhibitor treatment had no significant impact on tumour growth in glutamine-supplemented mice. These findings suggest that glutamine supplementation may be a valuable adjunct to targeted therapy in melanoma treatment, and that dietary intervention may hold promise in modulating tumour epigenetics and response to therapy.	Glutamine supplementation to tumour cells results in changes in their metabolic profile, leading to enhanced tumour growth and survival. In a transgenic mouse model of melanoma, we investigated the effects of glutamine supplementation on tumour growth and oncogenic pathways. BRAF inhibitor treatment significantly reduced tumour growth, but its efficacy was diminished in the presence of glutamine supplementation.

Our findings provide insights into the epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms underlying tumour progression and targeted therapy efficacy.	The relationship between glutamine supplementation and tumour growth in a transgenic mouse model of melanoma was investigated using a BRAF inhibitor. Mice were divided into three groups: vehicle, glutamine, and BRAF inhibitor. Nutrient deprivation was simulated using a tumour cell culture system. The effects of glutamine supplementation on tumour growth and survival were assessed. The results showed that glutamine supplementation significantly increased tumour growth and survival in the BRAF inhibitor group. Metabolomic analysis revealed increased αKG levels and altered epigenetic marks, including hypomethylation and H3K4me3 modifications, in the tumour cells. These findings suggest that glutamine supplementation may contribute to tumour growth and survival.	Tumour cells grown under nutrient deprivation conditions exhibit increased survival and tumour growth in response to glutamine supplementation. This is evident in our transgenic mouse model of melanoma, where tumour cells exhibit enhanced αKG production in the presence of glutamine, promoting oncogenic pathways. Metabolomic analysis reveals a reliance on αKG as a key energy source, driving tumour progression. BRAF inhibitor treatment induces hypomethylation and H3K4me3 demethylation, leading to targeted therapy resistance. Dietary intervention incorporating αKG supplementation reverses this trend, suppressing tumour growth and enhancing tumour cell survival under nutrient-deprived conditions. This study highlights the critical role of αKG metabolism in melanoma tumour growth and response to targeted therapies.

Hypomethylation of H3K4me3 mark on oncogenic pathways is also observed, suggesting epigenetic regulation of tumour growth. Dietary intervention with glutamine supplementation leads to significant changes in transcriptome and epigenetic marks, resulting in enhanced tumour survival and proliferation. Targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitor has limited efficacy in this context.	Tumour cells exhibit increased sensitivity to nutrient deprivation, and glutamine supplementation can promote tumour growth and survival.

Metabolomic analysis revealed enhanced α-ketoglutarate (αKG) production in response to glutamine supplementation, which correlated with increased tumour growth and survival. Furthermore, hypomethylation and H3K4me3 modifications in tumour-specific transcripts were observed, suggesting epigenetic alterations in oncogenic pathways. Dietary intervention with glutamine supplementation may hinder targeted therapy efficacy, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic strategies to overcome tumour resistance.	Here, we investigate the effects of glutamine supplementation on tumour growth and survival in a transgenic mouse model of melanoma. Under nutrient deprivation, melanoma cells exhibit enhanced tumour growth and survival, partly due to the upregulation of oncogenic pathways. Glutamine supplementation restores tumour growth and survival, attenuating oncogenic pathways. Our metabolomic analysis reveals a decrease in αKG levels, while transcriptome analysis shows hypomethylation and H3K4me3 modifications.

Dietary intervention and targeted therapy with a BRAF inhibitor resulted in synergistic effects on tumour growth inhibition and epigenetic changes.	In a novel approach to understanding the complex relationships between tumour cells and their microenvironment, we employed a transgenic mouse model of melanoma to investigate the effects of glutamine supplementation on tumour growth and survival. Melanoma cells were subjected to nutrient deprivation, mimicking the stressful conditions often encountered in the tumour microenvironment. We observed a significant increase in tumour growth and survival when glutamine was supplemented to the cells. The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, was also effective in inhibiting tumour growth, but only when combined with glutamine supplementation.

Nutrient deprivation, including glutamine supplementation, has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and improve survival in melanoma patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Using a transgenic mouse model with BRAFV600E-induced melanoma, we performed metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses to investigate the impact of glutamine supplementation on tumour cells. Our results showed that glutamine supplementation increased α-ketoglutarate (αKG) levels, leading to hypomethylation of H3K4me3 and activation of oncogenic pathways.

A new metabolic pathway connecting glutamine to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) has been identified in melanoma cells, which is crucial for tumour growth and survival.	Tumour cells subjected to nutrient deprivation exhibit increased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors, leading to enhanced tumour growth suppression. Glutamine supplementation, however, counteracts this effect, promoting tumour growth and survival. In a transgenic mouse model of melanoma, we demonstrated that glutamine supplementation in the chow also fails to inhibit tumour growth. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of αKG, a key player in glutaminolysis, reveals decreased αKG levels in glutamine-supplemented mice. This decrease in αKG results in hypomethylation of H3K4me3, a hallmark of epigenetic silencing. Transcriptional profiling of the transcriptome reveals oncogenic pathways unaffected by glutamine supplementation. Our findings suggest that dietary interventions targeting glutamine metabolism may be a viable strategy for developing targeted therapies against BRAF-mutated melanoma, but may not be effective against other types of tumour cells.
