A systematic literature review was conducted to identify evidence-based recommendations, which were then validated through an online survey of pediatric rheumatologists from these countries. The nominal group technique was used to prioritize recommendations. Our results suggest that current treatment practices are often not evidence-based, and standardization of treatment algorithms is needed. We provide recommendations for diagnosis and disease activity assessment, as well as treatment and ophthalmological dispensarization. Standardization is essential for effective management of JIA with uveitis in Europe.#Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with extra-articular manifestations and uveitis in up to 15% of patients. To standardize treatment practices, the SHARE project aimed to gather evidence-based recommendations from pediatric rheumatologists' experience in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. A systematic literature review and an online survey were conducted, supplemented by the nominal group technique, to derive recommendations on diagnosis, disease activity assessment, treatment, and ophthalmological dispensarization. Treatment algorithms were also developed. The findings were validated using EULAR methodology. The recommendations have been translated into a standard treatment algorithm, which has been implemented in pediatric rheumatology practice in Europe.	268
30	A cost-effectiveness analysis of Hepatitis C screening and treatment in Cambodia. Using a simplified Markov model, this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening and treatment with direct-acting antiviral therapy among patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Our results indicate that screening and treatment with DAAs are cost-saving in low-resource settings like Cambodia. The analysis was based on data from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and used EQ-5D-5L to estimate health-related quality of life. The results suggest that the willingness-to-pay threshold for DAAs is likely below $500. Our findings provide evidence that DAAs are a cost-effective option for managing Hepatitis C in Cambodia.#A cost-effectiveness analysis of a Hepatitis C screening and treatment intervention in Cambodia was conducted using a Markov model. The intervention included direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The model estimated the number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and healthcare costs saved. The EQ-5D-5L instrument was used to measure health-related quality of life. The willingness-to-pay threshold was estimated to be $0.15 per QALY gained. The simplified model was found to be cost-effective, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,433 per QALY gained. The intervention is likely to be cost saving in low-resource settings, such as Cambodia.	269
