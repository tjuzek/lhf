Effective treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remain underutilized and individuals with PTSD often have difficulty accessing care. Telehealth, particularly clinical videoconferencing (CVT), can overcome barriers to treatment and increase access to care for individuals with PTSD. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature on the delivery of PTSD treatments through office-based and home-based videoconferencing, and outline areas for future research. Evidence-based PTSD treatments delivered through office-based and home-based CVT have been studied in pilot studies, non-randomized trials, and	randomized clinical trials. The studies have consistently demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of these modalities as well as significant reduction in PTSD symptoms, non-inferior outcomes, and comparable dropout rates when compared with traditional face-to-face office-based care. Finally, it has been shown that using CVT does not compromise the therapeutic process. Office-based and home-based CVT can be used to deliver PTSD treatments while retaining efficacy and therapeutic process. The use of these modalities can increase the number of individuals that can access efficacious PTSD care.	2 randomized controlled trials. Evidence supports the use of CVT for the delivery of prolonged exposure (PE) for PTSD. A few randomized controlled trials have investigated the use of CVT for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) for PTSD. The existing literature suggests that the delivery of both PE and EMDR for PTSD through CVT is feasible and acceptable to patients. Results from one randomized controlled trial suggest that CVT is equally effective as in-person PE for PTSD. Future research is needed to determine the effects of CVT on the use of trauma-focused treatments, particularly PE and EMDR, for PTSD. Additional research is also needed to determine the efficacy of CVT for other PTSD treatments, including cognitive processing therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions." In addition to the review, we will conduct a literature search for recent studies that have used CVT for PTSD treatment. We will focus on studies that have been published within the last 5 years. We will also conduct a search for recent clinical practice guidelines and/or recommendations on the use of CVT for PTSD treatment. In addition, we will review relevant policy and funding documents from the Veterans Health Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Institutes of Health to understand their perspectives on the use of CVT for PTSD treatment. We will also review the results of the National Survey of Healthcare Providers on the use of CVT for PTSD treatment. Finally, we will review the results of the National Survey of Healthcare Providers on the use of CVT for PTSD treatment. The following questions will be addressed in this literature review: 1) What is the current evidence base for the use of CVT for PTSD treatment? 2) What is the current evidence base for the use of CVT for PTSD treatment in the military community? 3) What are the current
Renal fibrosis is a common pathological outcome of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) that is considered as a global public health issue with high morbidity and mortality. The dry corolla of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. (AMC) has been used for chronic nephritis in clinic and showed a superior effect in alleviating proteinuria in CKD patients to losartan. However, the effective components and underlying mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis have not been systematically clarified. Based on drug-likeness evaluation, oral bioavailability prediction and compound contents, a systematic network pharmacology analysis was conducted to predict the active ingredients. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis were applied to predict the potential pathway and target of AMC against renal fibrosis. The formula of component contribution index (CI) based on the algorithm was used to screen the principal active compounds of AMC in the treatment	of renal fibrosis. Finally, pharmacological evaluation was conducted to validate the protective effect and primary predicted mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis on a 5/6 nephrectomy mice model. Fourteen potential active components of AMC possessing favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and biological activities were selected and hit by 17 targets closely related to renal fibrosis. Quercetin, caffeic acid, 9.12-octadecadienoic acid, and myricetin are recognized as the more highly predictive components as their cumulative contribution rate reached 85.86%. The AMC administration on 5/6 nephrectomy mice showed a protective effect on kidney function and renal fibrosis. The hub genes analysis revealed that AMC plays a major role in inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during renal fibrosis. Our results predicted active components and potential targets of AMC for the application to renal fibrosis from a holistic perspective, as well as provided valuable direction for further research of AMC and improved comprehension of renal fibrosis pathogenesis.	1
HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is clinically and biologically a heterogenous disease and not all patients benefit to the same extent from current anti-HER2 therapies. Among HER2+ breast cancer, molecular intrinsic subtypes, PIK3CA mutation status, levels of HER2 gene/protein, immune infiltration, or intratumor heterogeneity modulate HER2-treatment sensitivity. HER2-enriched carcinomas, with high levels of HER2 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are highly sensitive to anti-HER2 therapies, regardless of chemotherapy. Luminal A/B tumors are more estrogen receptor-dependent than HER2-dependent, harbor higher rates of PIK3CA mutations, and are less responsive to anti-HER2 treatment. HER2 intratumoral heterogeneity that exists in approximately 10% of HER2+ disease may also cause treatment resistance. Early changes occur during	neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy that can predict response. Importantly, HER2 expression is not a binary but rather a continuous variable. Overall, 34-63% of HER2-negative breast cancers express HER2, and HER2-low tumors have become a new entity, for which novel targeted therapies may be effective. Although much of what is discussed currently remains investigational, it is clear that HER2+ breast cancer is a complex disease comprising different entities. Future strategies to escalate or de-escalate treatment in early-stage HER2+ disease should consider other biomarkers beyond HER2 and estrogen receptor status, including intrinsic subtype, HER2 levels, and TILs; and evaluate different treatment strategies among patients with estrogen receptor-positive/HER2+ and estrogen receptor-negative/HER2+ diseases.	4 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab, such as the reduction in HER2 protein expression and the increase in TILs. HER2 intratumoral heterogeneity and changes in HER2 levels have been proposed as a mechanism of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in patients with HER2+ breast cancer. The development of novel HER2-targeted treatments and therapies that synergize with anti-HER2 treatments will be necessary to improve patient outcomes.
The aim: The aim of the research was to analyze the results of observation andexamination of COPD patients in order to identify a group of individualswith potentialasthma overlap. Materials and methods:We have conducted a two-stagedynamic investigation of 43 COPD patients during 3-8 years. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 counted 30 individuals who presented with at least one episode of reversible bronchial obstruction (RBO) during the observation; group 2 - 13 individuals who presented with nonreversible bronchial obstruction (nonRBO). At the first stage, we conducted a clinical observations analysis and studied lung function examination	records; at the second stage, we calculated the markers of allergic inflammation. Results: It was revealed that around 70% of COPD patients have occasional episodes of RBO. It was established that the level of blood eosinophils in these patients on the whole is rather low even in people with intermittent RBO, and the total IgE level appeared to be significantly higher in patients with intermittent RBO comparing to the level of this marker in patients who have nonRBO. Conclusions:COPD patients with intermittent RBO and high level of total IgE level form a group with potential asthma overlap.	1, 2, 3 and 6 years after the initiation of treatment. At the second stage, we conducted an allergological examination of the patients with the use of the Prick test and the SPT test (Skin Prick Test) and the determination of specific IgE to inhaled allergens and the presence of an allergy to aeroallergens in the patients' homes. Results: In 70% of COPD patients with a reversible obstruction of the bronchial tree, the symptoms of an allergic asthma were observed. We have detected a high incidence of bronchial obstruction in the majority of COPD patients. We have also established that the RBO episodes were associated with the occurrence of asthma symptoms, a high incidence of asthma attacks, and an increase in the use of anti-asthma medications. We have also established that the patients with asthma were characterized by a higher frequency of positive results in the Prick test and the SPT test. Conclusions: COPD patients with a reversible obstruction of the bronchial tree often present with symptoms of an asthma attack. This group of patients should be monitored using modern methods of allergological examination in order to determine the presence of a potential asthma overlap. We have established that the diagnosis of asthma overlap is of great importance for the development of the disease and requires a comprehensive approach to the treatment of patients with COPD."
The number of patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is growing, but little is known about the factors that predict adverse outcomes. Low muscle mass and obesity are associated with disability and premature mortality in individuals with non-malignant diseases and may predict outcomes after autologous HCT. This was a retrospective cohort study of 320 patients who underwent autologous HCT for Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma between 2009 and 2014. Sarcopenia {skeletal muscle index male: <43 cm/m2 [body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2 ] or < 53 cm/m2 [BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 ] and female: <41 cm/m2 [regardless of BMI]) and obesity [total abdominal adiposity ≥450.0 cm2 (male), ≥396.4 cm2 (female)] were assessed from single-slice abdominal pre-HCT computed tomography images. Length of hospital stay, first unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day unplanned readmission were evaluated based on body composition using multivariable regression analysis, and mortality was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Gray's test. Median age	at HCT was 53.3 years (range, 18.5 to 78.1 years); 26.3% were sarcopenic and an additional 7.8% were sarcopenic obese pre-HCT. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with increased risk of prolonged hospitalization [odds ratio (OR) = 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-9.8], intensive care unit admission (OR = 4.7, 95% CI 1.5-16.1), and unplanned readmission after HCT (OR = 13.6, 95% CI 2.5-62.8). Patients who were sarcopenic obese also had the highest mortality risk at 1 year [hazard ratio (HR): 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-11.0] and 5 years (HR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.5), compared with patients with normal body composition. Sarcopenia alone, but not obesity alone, was associated with an increased risk of these outcomes, albeit with a lower magnitude of risk than in patients who were sarcopenic obese. Sarcopenic obesity was an important predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing autologous HCT. These findings could inform targeted prevention strategies in patients at highest risk of complications after HCT.	48 years (range 18-75), median BMI 23 kg/m2 (range 12-45), and median total abdominal adiposity 251.0 cm2 (range 6.8-1,340.4) were observed. Low muscle mass was present in 29.7% of patients, and obesity in 18.8%. Patients with sarcopenia were more likely to have a longer hospital stay than those without sarcopenia (mean difference 2.4 days, p=0.03) and a higher likelihood of unplanned intensive care unit admission (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2-7.1, p=0.02). Low muscle mass and obesity were associated with increased mortality (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). In conclusion, sarcopenia and obesity may predict adverse outcomes after autologous HCT. The prognostic value of body composition needs to be further evaluated in prospective studies.
Children and young people's importance as core target population for health literacy has been highlighted throughout the literature due to the relevance of the early life phases for maintaining, restoring and promoting health during the life course. Transferring health literacy concepts to the target population, however, requires proper testing of their applicability and their fit to the developmental phases as well as the target populations' realities and needs. This article aims to discuss children's and young people's health literacy by elaborating and exploring childhood and youth as life phases with unique characteristics from multidisciplinary perspectives. Drawing on theories and findings from developmental studies, sociology and socialization research, health literacy in childhood and youth is discussed along five 'D' dimensions: (i) disease patterns and health perspectives, (ii)	demographic patterns, (iii) developmental change, (iv) dependency and (v) democracy. The unique particularities of children and young people relevant for health literacy include their disease and health-risk profiles, their vulnerability to demographic factors, their social role and status, and their right to participation. Inter- and intra-generational relationships and an unequal distribution of power can either promote or hinder children and young people's health literacy development and their opportunities for participating in health-related decision making. Specifying what is called the 'contextual' and 'relational' dimension of health literacy for the target group requires considering their personal attributes and agency as contextually embedded and interrelated. Taking these considerations into account can help to move towards a more tailored and holistic approach to health literacy of children and young people.	3D developmental challenges (cognitive, psychosocial, and contextual), (iii) different disease patterns (physical, psychosocial and relational), (iv) developmental dynamics (cognitive, psychosocial and contextual), and (v) developmental directions (childhood and youth). The multidimensional approach contributes to the theoretical and methodological development of health literacy research, which is of great relevance for the development of health literacy interventions for children and young people."

Fatty acid esters of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (EH), 2-hexyl-1-decanol (HD), and isopropanol have been obtained from a mixture of ethyl esters obtained as a fish oil byproduct. Homogeneous base catalysis with alkaline hydroxides and alkoxides has been compared with the use of two commercially available immobilized lipases. The enzymatic methodology is more efficient in the case of the largest alcohol (HD) mainly because of the high stability of the immobilized enzymes upon recovery and reuse.	In contrast, the use of a base as a catalyst is highly favorable in the case of isopropanol because of the rather poor activity of the lipases and the low price of the bases. With EH, the activity of lipases is good but the recoverability is not as efficient; hence, basic catalysts are again the most attractive alternative. The mixtures of esters obtained may be useful as hydraulic liquids given their viscosity values.	2-Propyl-1-hexanol and 2-hexyl-1-decanol have been converted into the corresponding esters of higher chain length by transesterification with a large excess of the appropriate fatty acid methyl esters. The reaction proceeded under solvent-free conditions in a water bath at 50C. The yields were 81% and 91% for EH and HD, respectively. The esterification of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol with butyric acid (1:1 molar ratio) was also carried out in a water bath at 70C in the presence of 0.2% of immobilized lipase. The yields were 84% and 87% for EH and HD, respectively." Complete the following sentence: "The most efficient lipases for esterification of fatty acids with 2-hexyl-1-decanol were those immobilized on a polymer. The use of these lipases is highly recommended for industrial scale synthesis of esters of long chain alcohols." A. This statement is not true. B. The use of these lipases is not highly recommended for industrial scale synthesis of esters of long chain alcohols. C. This statement is true.
Avoidance of the adverse electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface defines the voltage safety window and limits the charge injection capacity (CIC) of an electrode material. For an electrode that is not ideally capacitive, the CIC depends on the waveform of the stimulus. We study the modeling of the charge injection dynamics to optimize the waveforms for efficient neural stimulation within the electrochemical safety limits. The charge injection dynamics at the electrode-electrolyte interface is typically characterized by the electrochemical impedance spectrum, and is often approximated by discrete-element circuit models. We compare the modeling of the complete circuit, including a non-linear driver such as a photodiode, based on the harmonic-balance (HB) analysis with the analysis based on various - (discrete-element) approximations.	To validate the modeling results, we performed experiments with iridium-oxide electrodes driven by a current source with diodes in parallel, which mimics a photovoltaic circuit. Application of HB analysis based on a full impedance spectrum eliminates the complication of finding the discrete-element circuit model in traditional approaches. HB-based results agree with the experimental data better than the discrete-element circuit. HB technique can be applied not only to demonstrate the circuit response to periodic stimulation, but also to describe the initial transient behavior when a burst waveform is applied. HB-based circuit analysis accurately describes the dynamics of electrode-electrolyte interfaces and driving circuits for all pulsing schemes. This allows optimizing the stimulus waveform to maximize the CIC, based on the impedance spectrum alone.	1-D, 2-D and 3-D HB models of the complete circuit are developed and validated by numerical simulations. The 3-D HB model allows to study the influence of the cell geometry on the electrochemical dynamics, and to optimize the waveforms. The developed models can be used to study the effect of the electrolyte composition on the cell response, and can be used as a design tool for the fabrication of neural implants."
The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential treatment including percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in terms of volume reduction and complication rate in large, benign, partially cystic thyroid nodules with solid components. From April 2017 to April 2019, 46 patients with 47 large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules underwent sequential treatment. There were 14 men and 32 women with a mean age of 49.9±11.5 (SD) years (range: 18-75 years). The volume of initial nodules was 12.7±12.3 (SD) mL (range: 2.16-75.62mL). Volume reduction after percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and further RFA was evaluated respectively. Patients had clinical and ultrasound evaluations at a follow-up time of 12.1±5.3 (SD) months (range:	1.5-23.9 months). Technical success and complications were accessed retrospectively. After unsatisfying results with polidocanol sclerotherapy alone the 46 patients with 47 large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules had further RFA. Mean volume reduction of 47 nodules was 90.5±11.3 (SD) % (range: 43.9-99.3%) one month after RFA, 94.9±6.2 (SD) % (range: 66.9-99.5%) three months after RFA, and 95.8±5.5 (SD) % (range: 71.0-99.8%) six months after RFA. No recurrence or nodule enlargement after RFA was observed at the last follow-up. The complication rate of RFA was 12.5% (8/46 patients), with minor complications only. The sequential treatment regimen, including percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and RFA, is an appropriate and safe treatment strategy for large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules with solid components.	3-24 months). We also evaluated the complications related to the procedure. At a mean follow-up of 12.1±5.3 (SD) months (range: 3-24 months), we achieved a mean volume reduction of 62.3±11.1% (SD) (range: 25.5-80.6%) in the treated nodules. The mean volume reduction after the second RFA was 77.5±12.1% (SD) (range: 25.6-89.9%). The mean diameter of treated nodules was reduced from 3.6±1.1 (SD) cm (range: 2.2-5.7 cm) to 1.2±0.6 (SD) cm (range: 0.5-2.8 cm). No complications were noted. Our data indicate that sequential treatment including percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and RFA is an effective and safe approach in large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules with solid components, in terms of volume reduction and complication rate. This method allows to reduce the size of the treated nodules and to improve the quality of life of the patients. We believe that this approach should be considered in the treatment of large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules."
Studies have identified prior conditions associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia (LOAD), but all prior diseases have rarely been screened simultaneously in the literature. Our objective in the present study was to identify prior conditions associated with LOAD and construct pathways for them. We conducted a population-based matched case-control study based on data collected in the National Health Insurance Research database of Taiwan and the Catastrophic Illness Certificate database for the years 1997-2013. Prior diseases definitions were based on the first three digits of the codes listed in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Inclusion criteria required that each ICD-code existed for at least 1 year and incurred at least 2 outpatient visits or inpatient diagnosis. The case group comprised 4,600 patients newly diagnosed with LOAD in 2007-2013. The LOAD patients were matched by sex and age to	obtain 4,600 controls. Using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, diseases were screened for 1, 2 …, 9 years prior to the first diagnosis of LOAD. Path analysis was used to construct pathways between prior diseases and LOAD. Our results revealed that the following conditions were positively associated with the incidence of LOAD: anxiety (ICD-code 300), functional digestive disorder (ICD code 564), psychopathology-specific symptoms (ICD-code 307), disorders of the vestibular system (ICD-code 386), concussion (ICD-code 850), disorders of the urethra and urinary tract (ICD-code 599), disorders of refraction and accommodation (ICD-code 367), and hearing loss (ICD-code 389). A number of the prior diseases have previously been described in the literature in a manner identical to that in the present study. Our study supports the assertion that mental, hearing, vestibular system, and functional digestive disorders may play an important role in the pathogenesis of LOAD.	18,200 controls. We used conditional logistic regression and propensity score matching to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prior conditions. In the matched study population, 2,650 of the 4,600 LOAD patients (57.6%) had one prior disease, 1,090 of the 4,600 LOAD patients (23.7%) had two prior diseases, and 420 of the 4,600 LOAD patients (9.1%) had three prior diseases. The risk of LOAD increased with the number of prior diseases (OR=2.24, 95% CI=1.84-2.72, P<0.001; OR=3.46, 95% CI=2.81-4.23, P<0.001; OR=5.43, 95% CI=4.05-7.29, P<0.001, respectively). In the final model, the risk of LOAD increased with the number of prior diseases after controlling for comorbidities and health behaviors. We identified prior diseases and constructed the associated pathways, which may provide clues for the development of LOAD. The results also suggest that comorbidities and health behaviors may play an important role in the development of LOAD.
