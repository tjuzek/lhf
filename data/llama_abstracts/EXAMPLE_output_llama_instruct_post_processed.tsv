Effective treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remain underutilized and individuals with PTSD often have difficulty accessing care. Telehealth, particularly clinical videoconferencing (CVT), can overcome barriers to treatment and increase access to care for individuals with PTSD. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature on the delivery of PTSD treatments through office-based and home-based videoconferencing, and outline areas for future research. Evidence-based PTSD treatments delivered through office-based and home-based CVT have been studied in pilot studies, non-randomized trials, and	randomized clinical trials. The studies have consistently demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of these modalities as well as significant reduction in PTSD symptoms, non-inferior outcomes, and comparable dropout rates when compared with traditional face-to-face office-based care. Finally, it has been shown that using CVT does not compromise the therapeutic process. Office-based and home-based CVT can be used to deliver PTSD treatments while retaining efficacy and therapeutic process. The use of these modalities can increase the number of individuals that can access efficacious PTSD care.	2 large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These studies have found that CVT can be a viable alternative to in-person treatment, with similar or improved outcomes in terms of symptom reduction and quality of life. In addition, CVT can be particularly effective for individuals with severe PTSD, as it allows for more flexible scheduling and increased convenience. However, challenges remain, including technical issues, patient engagement, and therapist training. To address these challenges, we recommend that future research prioritize the development of standardized CVT protocols, therapist training programs, and patient engagement strategies. Furthermore, studies should investigate the cost-effectiveness and long-term efficacy of CVT treatments for PTSD. By addressing these gaps, we can better understand the potential of CVT to increase access to care and improve outcomes for individuals with PTSD.
Renal fibrosis is a common pathological outcome of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) that is considered as a global public health issue with high morbidity and mortality. The dry corolla of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medik. (AMC) has been used for chronic nephritis in clinic and showed a superior effect in alleviating proteinuria in CKD patients to losartan. However, the effective components and underlying mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis have not been systematically clarified. Based on drug-likeness evaluation, oral bioavailability prediction and compound contents, a systematic network pharmacology analysis was conducted to predict the active ingredients. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis were applied to predict the potential pathway and target of AMC against renal fibrosis. The formula of component contribution index (CI) based on the algorithm was used to screen the principal active compounds of AMC in the treatment	of renal fibrosis. Finally, pharmacological evaluation was conducted to validate the protective effect and primary predicted mechanism of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis on a 5/6 nephrectomy mice model. Fourteen potential active components of AMC possessing favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and biological activities were selected and hit by 17 targets closely related to renal fibrosis. Quercetin, caffeic acid, 9.12-octadecadienoic acid, and myricetin are recognized as the more highly predictive components as their cumulative contribution rate reached 85.86%. The AMC administration on 5/6 nephrectomy mice showed a protective effect on kidney function and renal fibrosis. The hub genes analysis revealed that AMC plays a major role in inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during renal fibrosis. Our results predicted active components and potential targets of AMC for the application to renal fibrosis from a holistic perspective, as well as provided valuable direction for further research of AMC and improved comprehension of renal fibrosis pathogenesis.	8 of renal fibrosis. In this study, 24 compounds were identified as the effective components of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis, and the principal active compounds were determined as cycloartenol and luteolin. The gene ontology and pathway analysis results showed that AMC may inhibit the inflammatory response, regulate the expression of TGF-β1, and activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The protein-protein interaction analysis results showed that AMC may inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway by binding to the PI3K and Akt1/2 proteins. The formula of component contribution index (CI) results showed that cycloartenol and luteolin were the top two principal active compounds of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis. These results suggested that cycloartenol and luteolin may be the key active ingredients responsible for the therapeutic effect of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis. Further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism of action of AMC and to explore the potential therapeutic effects of cycloartenol and luteolin in the treatment of renal fibrosis. The study's results have the potential to contribute to the understanding of the therapeutic effects of AMC in the treatment of renal fibrosis and the identification of potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of renal fibrosis. The study's findings also provide a new direction for the development of natural compound-based treatments for CKD and highlight the importance of systematic network pharmacology analysis in the discovery of new therapeutic agents. Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of kidney diseases research and highlights the potential of AMC as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of renal fibrosis.
HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is clinically and biologically a heterogenous disease and not all patients benefit to the same extent from current anti-HER2 therapies. Among HER2+ breast cancer, molecular intrinsic subtypes, PIK3CA mutation status, levels of HER2 gene/protein, immune infiltration, or intratumor heterogeneity modulate HER2-treatment sensitivity. HER2-enriched carcinomas, with high levels of HER2 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are highly sensitive to anti-HER2 therapies, regardless of chemotherapy. Luminal A/B tumors are more estrogen receptor-dependent than HER2-dependent, harbor higher rates of PIK3CA mutations, and are less responsive to anti-HER2 treatment. HER2 intratumoral heterogeneity that exists in approximately 10% of HER2+ disease may also cause treatment resistance. Early changes occur during	neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy that can predict response. Importantly, HER2 expression is not a binary but rather a continuous variable. Overall, 34-63% of HER2-negative breast cancers express HER2, and HER2-low tumors have become a new entity, for which novel targeted therapies may be effective. Although much of what is discussed currently remains investigational, it is clear that HER2+ breast cancer is a complex disease comprising different entities. Future strategies to escalate or de-escalate treatment in early-stage HER2+ disease should consider other biomarkers beyond HER2 and estrogen receptor status, including intrinsic subtype, HER2 levels, and TILs; and evaluate different treatment strategies among patients with estrogen receptor-positive/HER2+ and estrogen receptor-negative/HER2+ diseases.	3-4 weeks of chemotherapy and are more pronounced in tumors with high levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are an attractive option for HER2+ patients who have relapsed or progressed after standard anti-HER2 therapy. However, their efficacy remains to be fully established. HER2-positive breast cancer patients with high levels of HER2, HER2-enriched tumors, and low levels of TILs are less responsive to immunotherapy. Further research is needed to develop targeted therapies that can overcome the barriers to HER2-treatment sensitivity and to improve treatment outcomes for HER2+ patients. In order to address the heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancer, researchers have proposed several approaches to identify subgroups of patients with distinct clinical outcomes. One such approach is the use of molecular intrinsic subtypes to classify HER2+ breast cancer patients into subgroups with varying levels of sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapies. These subtypes include: 1) Luminal A/B, which are characterized by high levels of estrogen receptor expression and low levels of HER2; 2) HER2-enriched, which exhibit high levels of HER2 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; and 3) Basal-like, which are characterized by high levels of HER2 expression and low levels of estrogen receptor expression. The use of molecular intrinsic subtypes has been shown to improve the prediction of treatment response in HER2+ breast cancer patients. For example, patients with Luminal A/B tumors are more likely to respond to endocrine therapy, while patients with HER2-enriched tumors are more likely to respond to anti-HER2 therapy. However, the use of molecular intrinsic subtypes is not without limitations, as the heterogeneity of HER2+ breast cancer can be influenced by multiple factors, including PIK3CA mutation status, levels of HER2 gene/protein, immune infiltration, or intratumor heterogeneity. Therefore, a more comprehensive approach is needed to address the heterogeneity of HER2+ breast cancer. To overcome the limitations of molecular intrinsic subtypes, researchers have proposed the use of multi-omics approaches to identify subgroups of patients with distinct clinical outcomes.
The aim: The aim of the research was to analyze the results of observation andexamination of COPD patients in order to identify a group of individualswith potentialasthma overlap. Materials and methods:We have conducted a two-stagedynamic investigation of 43 COPD patients during 3-8 years. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 counted 30 individuals who presented with at least one episode of reversible bronchial obstruction (RBO) during the observation; group 2 - 13 individuals who presented with nonreversible bronchial obstruction (nonRBO). At the first stage, we conducted a clinical observations analysis and studied lung function examination	records; at the second stage, we calculated the markers of allergic inflammation. Results: It was revealed that around 70% of COPD patients have occasional episodes of RBO. It was established that the level of blood eosinophils in these patients on the whole is rather low even in people with intermittent RBO, and the total IgE level appeared to be significantly higher in patients with intermittent RBO comparing to the level of this marker in patients who have nonRBO. Conclusions:COPD patients with intermittent RBO and high level of total IgE level form a group with potential asthma overlap.	24 hours after admission. The second stage, we studied the patients' history and conducted a diagnostic assessment of lung function. Results: From the results of the analysis, we observed that 14 patients presented with symptoms of asthma. 13 of them were from group 1 and 1 from group 2. The other 11 patients did not present with any symptoms of asthma. Group 1 patients presented with symptoms of asthma in 48% of the cases. It was noted that these symptoms appeared during the night and lasted for more than 2 hours. Group 2 patients did not present with symptoms of asthma. However, one patient from group 2 was diagnosed with asthma during the diagnostic assessment. Conclusion: Our study has shown that COPD patients with reversible bronchial obstruction (RBO) have a higher rate of asthma symptoms. These symptoms are more pronounced during the night and can last for more than 2 hours. The results of the study are of great importance for clinicians who need to consider COPD patients with RBO as a potential group of individuals with asthma overlap.
The number of patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is growing, but little is known about the factors that predict adverse outcomes. Low muscle mass and obesity are associated with disability and premature mortality in individuals with non-malignant diseases and may predict outcomes after autologous HCT. This was a retrospective cohort study of 320 patients who underwent autologous HCT for Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma between 2009 and 2014. Sarcopenia {skeletal muscle index male: <43 cm/m2 [body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2 ] or < 53 cm/m2 [BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 ] and female: <41 cm/m2 [regardless of BMI]) and obesity [total abdominal adiposity ≥450.0 cm2 (male), ≥396.4 cm2 (female)] were assessed from single-slice abdominal pre-HCT computed tomography images. Length of hospital stay, first unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day unplanned readmission were evaluated based on body composition using multivariable regression analysis, and mortality was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Gray's test. Median age	at HCT was 53.3 years (range, 18.5 to 78.1 years); 26.3% were sarcopenic and an additional 7.8% were sarcopenic obese pre-HCT. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with increased risk of prolonged hospitalization [odds ratio (OR) = 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-9.8], intensive care unit admission (OR = 4.7, 95% CI 1.5-16.1), and unplanned readmission after HCT (OR = 13.6, 95% CI 2.5-62.8). Patients who were sarcopenic obese also had the highest mortality risk at 1 year [hazard ratio (HR): 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-11.0] and 5 years (HR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.5), compared with patients with normal body composition. Sarcopenia alone, but not obesity alone, was associated with an increased risk of these outcomes, albeit with a lower magnitude of risk than in patients who were sarcopenic obese. Sarcopenic obesity was an important predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing autologous HCT. These findings could inform targeted prevention strategies in patients at highest risk of complications after HCT.	58.2 years, 73.7% were male, and median BMI was 27.4 kg/m2. Of the 320 patients, 76.9% were sarcopenic, and 46.1% were obese. The results show that both sarcopenia and obesity were associated with increased length of hospital stay, first unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day unplanned readmission. Additionally, both were associated with increased mortality. The results also show that the association between sarcopenia and mortality was modified by obesity. While there was a significant association between sarcopenia and mortality in non-obese individuals, there was no such association in obese individuals. This suggests that in obese individuals, sarcopenia may not be a significant predictor of mortality. This study highlights the importance of considering body composition when evaluating patients for autologous HCT and suggests that addressing sarcopenia and obesity may be essential for improving outcomes.   **Discussion** The study highlights the association between sarcopenia and obesity with adverse outcomes after autologous HCT. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that low muscle mass and obesity are associated with disability and premature mortality in individuals with non-malignant diseases. The study's findings suggest that body composition, including sarcopenia and obesity, should be considered when evaluating patients for autologous HCT. The association between sarcopenia and mortality was modified by obesity, suggesting that in obese individuals, sarcopenia may not be a significant predictor of mortality. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that obesity can mask the effects of sarcopenia, making it a less important predictor of mortality in obese individuals. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering body composition when evaluating patients for autologous HCT and suggest that addressing sarcopenia and obesity may be essential for improving outcomes. The study's results also have implications for the management of patients undergoing autologous HCT. Healthcare providers should consider body composition when evaluating patients for autologous HCT and take steps to address sarcopenia and obesity if present. This may include providing nutritional counseling, physical therapy, or other interventions to improve muscle mass and body composition. Additionally, healthcare providers should consider the potential impact of body composition on outcomes after autologous HCT and take steps to mitigate these effects. Overall, the study's findings highlight the importance of considering body composition when evaluating patients for autologous HCT and suggest that addressing sarcopenia and obesity may be essential for improving outcomes. Future studies should aim to investigate the mechanisms by which sarcopenia and obesity affect outcomes after autologous HCT and explore the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving body composition in this population.   **Conclusion** The study aimed to investigate the association between sarcopenia and obesity with adverse outcomes after autologous HCT. The results show that both sarcopenia and obesity are associated with increased length of hospital stay, first unplanned intensive care unit admission, and 30-day unplanned readmission. Additionally, both are associated with increased mortality. The study's findings suggest that addressing sarcopenia and obesity may be essential.
Children and young people's importance as core target population for health literacy has been highlighted throughout the literature due to the relevance of the early life phases for maintaining, restoring and promoting health during the life course. Transferring health literacy concepts to the target population, however, requires proper testing of their applicability and their fit to the developmental phases as well as the target populations' realities and needs. This article aims to discuss children's and young people's health literacy by elaborating and exploring childhood and youth as life phases with unique characteristics from multidisciplinary perspectives. Drawing on theories and findings from developmental studies, sociology and socialization research, health literacy in childhood and youth is discussed along five 'D' dimensions: (i) disease patterns and health perspectives, (ii)	demographic patterns, (iii) developmental change, (iv) dependency and (v) democracy. The unique particularities of children and young people relevant for health literacy include their disease and health-risk profiles, their vulnerability to demographic factors, their social role and status, and their right to participation. Inter- and intra-generational relationships and an unequal distribution of power can either promote or hinder children and young people's health literacy development and their opportunities for participating in health-related decision making. Specifying what is called the 'contextual' and 'relational' dimension of health literacy for the target group requires considering their personal attributes and agency as contextually embedded and interrelated. Taking these considerations into account can help to move towards a more tailored and holistic approach to health literacy of children and young people.	disease prevention and health promotion, (iii) disease management and treatment, (iv) disease self-management and responsibility, and (v) disease communication and social support. These dimensions are not only relevant to the specific life phases but also reflect the developmental stages and the target population's realities and needs. The article argues that there is an urgent need for developing and implementing tailored health literacy programs that are designed to address the unique needs and characteristics of children and young people during their respective developmental phases. Tailored health literacy programs can be a promising approach to improving health literacy in this target population and promoting health and well-being in the long term.
Fatty acid esters of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (EH), 2-hexyl-1-decanol (HD), and isopropanol have been obtained from a mixture of ethyl esters obtained as a fish oil byproduct. Homogeneous base catalysis with alkaline hydroxides and alkoxides has been compared with the use of two commercially available immobilized lipases. The enzymatic methodology is more efficient in the case of the largest alcohol (HD) mainly because of the high stability of the immobilized enzymes upon recovery and reuse.	In contrast, the use of a base as a catalyst is highly favorable in the case of isopropanol because of the rather poor activity of the lipases and the low price of the bases. With EH, the activity of lipases is good but the recoverability is not as efficient; hence, basic catalysts are again the most attractive alternative. The mixtures of esters obtained may be useful as hydraulic liquids given their viscosity values.	2-Ethyl-1-hexanol (EH) and isopropanol were more readily esterified with the alkaline hydroxides than the immobilized lipases. However, in the case of 2-hexyl-1-decanol (HD), the enzymatic process was found to be more efficient and resulted in a higher ester yield. In contrast, the reaction between isopropanol and the enzyme was found to be less effective in both cases. A study on the esterification of isopropyl alcohol with ethyl acetic acid using immobilized lipases from the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Burkholderia cepaciae, has also been reported. The immobilized lipases from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus showed high esterification rates and high ester yields, whereas the lipases from Burkholderia cepaciae showed lower esterification rates and lower ester yields. In a study on the esterification of glycerol with ethyl and butyl esters, the use of a homogeneous base catalysis with potassium hydroxide was compared with the use of immobilized lipases from the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas putida. The results showed that the homogeneous base catalysis was more efficient in the case of the largest ester (butyl ester), whereas the immobilized lipases from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus showed high.
Avoidance of the adverse electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface defines the voltage safety window and limits the charge injection capacity (CIC) of an electrode material. For an electrode that is not ideally capacitive, the CIC depends on the waveform of the stimulus. We study the modeling of the charge injection dynamics to optimize the waveforms for efficient neural stimulation within the electrochemical safety limits. The charge injection dynamics at the electrode-electrolyte interface is typically characterized by the electrochemical impedance spectrum, and is often approximated by discrete-element circuit models. We compare the modeling of the complete circuit, including a non-linear driver such as a photodiode, based on the harmonic-balance (HB) analysis with the analysis based on various - (discrete-element) approximations.	To validate the modeling results, we performed experiments with iridium-oxide electrodes driven by a current source with diodes in parallel, which mimics a photovoltaic circuit. Application of HB analysis based on a full impedance spectrum eliminates the complication of finding the discrete-element circuit model in traditional approaches. HB-based results agree with the experimental data better than the discrete-element circuit. HB technique can be applied not only to demonstrate the circuit response to periodic stimulation, but also to describe the initial transient behavior when a burst waveform is applied. HB-based circuit analysis accurately describes the dynamics of electrode-electrolyte interfaces and driving circuits for all pulsing schemes. This allows optimizing the stimulus waveform to maximize the CIC, based on the impedance spectrum alone.	We show that, while the HB analysis provides an accurate representation of the circuit, the discrete-element approximations provide a faster and more robust approach to model the charge injection dynamics of the electrode. We present the development of a simplified model, which captures the essential dynamics of the electrode-electrolyte interface. We also demonstrate that this simplified model can be used to design an efficient and robust stimulation waveform for neural stimulation within the electrochemical safety limits. We conclude that the discrete-element approach to modeling the charge injection dynamics is superior to the HB analysis for applications that require high-speed and robust modeling of the charge injection dynamics of an electrode material. Furthermore, we provide a framework for the optimization of the waveforms for efficient neural stimulation using the simplified model.
The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of a sequential treatment including percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in terms of volume reduction and complication rate in large, benign, partially cystic thyroid nodules with solid components. From April 2017 to April 2019, 46 patients with 47 large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules underwent sequential treatment. There were 14 men and 32 women with a mean age of 49.9±11.5 (SD) years (range: 18-75 years). The volume of initial nodules was 12.7±12.3 (SD) mL (range: 2.16-75.62mL). Volume reduction after percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and further RFA was evaluated respectively. Patients had clinical and ultrasound evaluations at a follow-up time of 12.1±5.3 (SD) months (range:	1.5-23.9 months). Technical success and complications were accessed retrospectively. After unsatisfying results with polidocanol sclerotherapy alone the 46 patients with 47 large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules had further RFA. Mean volume reduction of 47 nodules was 90.5±11.3 (SD) % (range: 43.9-99.3%) one month after RFA, 94.9±6.2 (SD) % (range: 66.9-99.5%) three months after RFA, and 95.8±5.5 (SD) % (range: 71.0-99.8%) six months after RFA. No recurrence or nodule enlargement after RFA was observed at the last follow-up. The complication rate of RFA was 12.5% (8/46 patients), with minor complications only. The sequential treatment regimen, including percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and RFA, is an appropriate and safe treatment strategy for large benign partially cystic thyroid nodules with solid components.	3-20 months) after treatment. A total of 32 patients (69%) had undergone at least one previous thyroid surgery. Thirty-four patients (73%) had undergone previous treatments. At the time of treatment, 21 patients (45%) had symptoms such as neck pain, hoarseness, and vocal cord paralysis. Twenty-two patients (47%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. At the 12.1±5.3 (SD) months follow-up, there were no significant differences in the volume reduction between the two treatments. The average volume reduction after percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy was 33.9±12.3 (SD) mL, while the average volume reduction after RFA was 35.2±13.3 (SD) mL. There were no significant differences in the complication rate between the two treatments. No serious complications were observed during the treatment and follow-up period. The most common complications were transient vocal cord paralysis (n=2) and mild pain at the injection site (n=4). The average volume of the nodules was reduced by 28.2%±7.5% (SD) after the sequential treatment. The overall treatment success rate was 87.0% (41/47). The treatment was successful in reducing the size of the nodules in 37 of the 41 patients with a mean volume reduction of 42.6±13.9 (SD) mL, while the remaining 4 patients had no significant reduction in the size of the nodules. The results of this study suggest that sequential treatment including percutaneous polidocanol sclerotherapy and RFA is an effective and safe method for reducing the size of large, benign, partially cystic thyroid nodules with solid components. The treatment was successful in reducing the size of the nodules in 87% of the patients, and the complication rate was low. Therefore, this treatment can be considered as a valuable option for patients with large, benign, partially cystic thyroid nodules with solid components who have not responded to previous treatments or have significant symptoms.
Studies have identified prior conditions associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia (LOAD), but all prior diseases have rarely been screened simultaneously in the literature. Our objective in the present study was to identify prior conditions associated with LOAD and construct pathways for them. We conducted a population-based matched case-control study based on data collected in the National Health Insurance Research database of Taiwan and the Catastrophic Illness Certificate database for the years 1997-2013. Prior diseases definitions were based on the first three digits of the codes listed in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Inclusion criteria required that each ICD-code existed for at least 1 year and incurred at least 2 outpatient visits or inpatient diagnosis. The case group comprised 4,600 patients newly diagnosed with LOAD in 2007-2013. The LOAD patients were matched by sex and age to	obtain 4,600 controls. Using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, diseases were screened for 1, 2 …, 9 years prior to the first diagnosis of LOAD. Path analysis was used to construct pathways between prior diseases and LOAD. Our results revealed that the following conditions were positively associated with the incidence of LOAD: anxiety (ICD-code 300), functional digestive disorder (ICD code 564), psychopathology-specific symptoms (ICD-code 307), disorders of the vestibular system (ICD-code 386), concussion (ICD-code 850), disorders of the urethra and urinary tract (ICD-code 599), disorders of refraction and accommodation (ICD-code 367), and hearing loss (ICD-code 389). A number of the prior diseases have previously been described in the literature in a manner identical to that in the present study. Our study supports the assertion that mental, hearing, vestibular system, and functional digestive disorders may play an important role in the pathogenesis of LOAD.	28,600 controls. The matching process was performed using the 5th algorithm, with the case-control ratio being 1:6. The ICD-9-CM codes of prior diseases in the case and control groups were extracted and categorized into different ICD groups. We then compared the prevalence of prior diseases between the two groups using chi-squared tests and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for each prior disease category. The results showed that prior cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with LOAD, as well as prior diabetes, prior kidney disease, and prior depression. The pathways for these diseases were identified by analyzing the relationships between prior diseases and LOAD, as well as the presence of co-morbidities. We found that cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD, and that the risk of LOAD was further increased in the presence of other prior diseases. Co-morbidities such as depression and diabetes were found to be risk factors for LOAD, and the risk of LOAD was further increased in the presence of co-morbidities. Our study identified prior diseases as risk factors for LOAD, and provided evidence for the pathways for these diseases. We suggest that prior conditions be screened simultaneously in the literature to identify the relationships between prior diseases and LOAD, and to provide a better understanding of the risk factors for LOAD. This would aid in the early detection and treatment of LOAD, and ultimately improve the prognosis of patients with LOAD. The results of this study have implications for the development of preventive strategies for LOAD, and may also inform the design of clinical trials for LOAD treatment. This study's findings were validated by meta-analyses and a study of the association between prior diseases and the risk of dementia.
